## **Overview**
---

ATP is the "energy currency" of the cell. It is the "energy molecule" of almost all forms of life, and is used to power many energy-requiring cellular reactions.

Cellular respiration is a metabolic pathway that breaks down glucose to yield ATP (i.e: glucose from your food is broken down to yield ATP for energy)

During this process, glucose and oxygen are converted into carbon dioxide and water.

In order to yield ATP from glucose, cellular respiration goes through multiple stages including glycolysis, pyruvate oxidation, Krebs cycle (aka citric acid cycle), and oxidative phosphorylation. As seen below:

Two important terms to know: anabolism and catabolism.
* Anabolism means constructing larger molecules from smaller units.
* Catabolism is the breaking down of larger molecules into smaller units.
    * a good way to remember it is that "cats" (catabolism) cause a mess and break things.
