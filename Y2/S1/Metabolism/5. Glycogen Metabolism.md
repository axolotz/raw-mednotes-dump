## **Structure and Function**
---

Glycogen is the stored form of glucose that is made up of many connected glucose molecules. A single glycogen molecule consists of hundreds of thousands of glucose molecules.

Glycogen can be synthesized and degraded. There is about 400g of glycogen in muscle, 100g in liver. They function to:

* Muscle glycogen serves as fuel reserve for ATP synthesis during muscle contraction
* Liver glycogen is to maintain blood glucose concentration (particularly during the early stages of a fast)

When degraded, glucose is released as glucose-1-P, which has to be isomerized (into glucose-6-P) first before going into glycolysis. Opposite happens during synthesis.

Basically:

    synthesis (for storage):   glucose -> g-6-P -> g-1-P -> glycogen
    degradation (for use):  glycolysis <- g-6-P <- g-1-P <- glycogen

> *Degradation is NOT a reverse of synthesis, but these are the major shared elements to help you remember.*

## **Degradation (glycogenolysis)**
---

Liver glycogen stores increase during well-fed states and deplete during fasting. Muscle glycogen lasts longer and is moderately decreased in prolonged fasting (weeks).

Degradative pathway that mobilizes stored glycogen in liver and skeletal muscle is not a reversal of the synthetic rxns.

* Degradation begins from non-reducing end
* Glycogen phosphorylase sequentially cleaves glycosidic bonds between residues (by phosphorylysis)
    * result is glucose-1-P molecules
* Cleavage stops right before reaching a branching point

Cleavage continues until four glucosyl units remain before a branching point. This structure is called a limit dextrin. Phosphorylase cannot degrade any further.

> *Like eating tree branches, but you can only eat in a single branch at a time. You start off from the end of a branch and work your way in. You stop whenever your branch joins another branch.*

After reaching a branching point, debranching enzyme steps in. Debranching enzyme has two roles: transferase and glucosidase

* Transferase will transfer 3 residues to the main branch/chain
* Remaining glucose residue (branching point) is cleaved off by α(1→6)-glucosidase

Thus, the process alternates between both enzymes (phosphorylase and debranching).

Glucose-1-P will then be isomerized to G-6-P by phosphoglucomutase in order to undergo glycolysis.

Basically:

    glycolysis <- g-6-P <- g-1-P <- glycogen

### **Lysosomal Degradation**

There is a second pathway for glycogen degradation.

* 1-3% of glycogen is degraded by lysosomal enzyme α(1→4)-glucosidase (acid maltase)
* Purpose unknown
* The enzyme's deficiency causes accumulation of glycogen in vacuoles in lysosomes
    * results in glycogen storage disease Type II (aka Pompe disease)

## **Synthesis (glycogenesis)**
---

Quickly going back over past notes, glucose can be phosphorylated into glucose-6-P by hexokinase or glucokinase. This is the first step of glycolysis. However this molecule may take different pathways (and not go into glycolysis), one of these pathways is glycogenesis.

Glycogen is synthesized by the addition of glucose molecules. UDP-glucose is the active donor of glucose units.

1. g-6-P converted into g-1-P (via phosphoglucomutase)
2. g-1-P is combined with UTP to give UDP-glucose (via UDP-glucose-pyrophosphorylase)
3. Two UDP-glucose molecules are combined (via glycogen synthase)
    * UDP is then released
    * step repeats to create a long chain
