## **Structure and Function**
---

Glycogen is the stored form of glucose that is made up of many connected glucose molecules. A single glycogen molecule consists of hundreds of thousands of glucose molecules.

Glycogen can be synthesized and degraded. There is about 400g of glycogen in muscle, 100g in liver. They function to:

* Muscle glycogen serves as fuel reserve for ATP synthesis during muscle contraction
* Liver glycogen is to maintain blood glucose concentration (particularly during the early stages of a fast)

When degraded, glucose is released as glucose-1-P, which has to be isomerized (into glucose-6-P) first before going into glycolysis. Opposite happens during synthesis.

Basically:

    synthesis (for storage):   glucose -> G-6-P -> G-1-P -> glycogen
    degradation (for use):       usage <- G-6-P <- G-1-P <- glycogen

> *Degradation is NOT a reverse of synthesis, but these are the major shared elements to help you remember.*

## **Degradation (glycogenolysis)**
---

Liver glycogen stores increase during well-fed states and deplete during fasting. Muscle glycogen lasts longer and is moderately decreased in prolonged fasting (weeks).

Degradative pathway that mobilizes stored glycogen in liver and skeletal muscle is not a reversal of the synthetic rxns.

* Degradation begins from non-reducing end
* Glycogen phosphorylase sequentially cleaves glycosidic bonds between residues (by phosphorylysis)
    * result is glucose-1-P molecules
* Cleavage stops right before reaching a branching point

Cleavage continues until four glucosyl units remain before a branching point. This structure is called a limit dextrin. Phosphorylase cannot degrade any further.

> *Like eating tree branches, but you can only eat in a single branch at a time. You start off from the end of a branch and work your way in. You stop whenever your branch joins another branch.*

After reaching a branching point, debranching enzyme steps in. Debranching enzyme has two roles: transferase and glucosidase

* Transferase will transfer 3 residues to the main branch/chain
* Remaining glucose residue (branching point) is cleaved off by α(1→6)-glucosidase

Thus, the process alternates between both enzymes (phosphorylase and debranching).

Glucose-1-P will then be isomerized to G-6-P by phosphoglucomutase in order to be used.

* In liver: G-6-P turned directly into glucose (for blood) via phosphatase.
* In muscles: G-6-P goes into glycolysis (no phosphatase)

Basically:

    usage <- G-6-P <- G-1-P <- glycogen

### **Lysosomal Degradation**

There is a second pathway for glycogen degradation.

* 1-3% of glycogen is degraded by lysosomal enzyme α(1→4)-glucosidase (acid maltase)
* Purpose unknown
* The enzyme's deficiency causes accumulation of glycogen in vacuoles in lysosomes
    * results in glycogen storage disease Type II (aka Pompe disease)
        *
## **Synthesis (glycogenesis)**
---

Quickly going back over past notes, glucose can be phosphorylated into glucose-6-P by hexokinase or glucokinase. This is the first step of glycolysis. However this molecule may take different pathways (and not go into glycolysis), one of these pathways is glycogenesis.

> *watch this before continuing on: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_5ubq6MikQ*

Glycogen is synthesized by the addition of glucose molecules. UDP-glucose is the active donor of glucose units.

* G-6-P converted into G-1-P (via phosphoglucomutase)
* G-1-P is combined with UTP to give UDP-glucose (via UDP-glucose-pyrophosphorylase)
* Two UDP-glucose molecules are combined (via glycogen synthase)
    * UDP is then released
    * step repeats to create a long chain
<!-- -->
* Glycogen synthase can only elongate existing chains of glucose, not start its own
* A glycogen fragment can serve as a primer in cells
* In the absence of glycogen fragments, glycogenin serves as a primer
<!-- -->
* Branches on the chain that was created are formed via branching enzyme
    * removes a number of glucose molecules
    * reattaches them but with a α(1,6) linkage, creating a branching point

Synthesis requires ATP.

* 1 ATP and 1 UTP required to add 1 glucose into glycogen chain

## **Diseases**

### **Von Gierke Disease**

* Glucose-6-phosphatase enzyme deficiency
* Liver, kidney, instestines (not in muscles)
* Liver cannot convert glucose-6-P into glucose
    * causes hypoglycemia when fasting
* Glycogen synthesis and structure is not affected
* Hepatomegaly fatty liver (enlargement of liver)
* Growth retardation

### **McArdle Syndrome**

* Muscle phosphorylase deficiency
    * the enzyme that cleaves glycosidic bonds between residues during degradation
* Only muscles affected
* Muscle weakness after exercise
* No increase in lactate after exercise

### **Pompe Disease**

* α(1→4)-glucosidase deficiency
    * the enzyme in charge of lysosomal degradation
* Lysosomal degradation pathway only degrades 1-3%
* Enzyme's deficiency causes accumulation of glycogen in lysosomes
* Affects liver, muscles, heart
* Massive cardiomegaly
* May die from hudden heart failure

|Disease|Enzyme Deficient|Organs Affected|

|Von Gierke|glucose-6-phosphatase|liver, kidney, intestines|
|McArdle|phosphorylase|muscles|
|Pompe|α(1→4)-glucosidase|liver, muscles, heart

## **Regulation**
---

To properly maintain blood glucose levels, glycogen synthesis and degradation are tightly regulated.

Regulation occurs on two levels:

* Hormonal (for body as a whole)
* Allosteric (for specific tissue)

### **Hormonal**

Hormonal regulation mainly controls the enzymes for synthesis and degradation (synthase and phosphorylase).

* Synthase (synthesis): active when no phosphate is attached.
* Phosphorylase (degradation): active when there is phosphate attached.

Thus, adding phospate group to both enzymes will encourage degradation, removing from both enzymes encourages synthesis.

The main hormonal regulators are:

* Glucagon and Epinephrine
* Insulin

The binding of glucagon or ephinephrine to G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) signals for degradation:

* Binding of glucagon or epinephrine to GPCR activates adenylyl cyclase
* Adenylyl cyclase catalyzes cAMP synthesis.
* cAMP activates protein kinase A
* PKA phosphorylates both enzymes.
    * activates phosphorylase, inactivates synthase
* Promotes degradation
<!-- -->
    binding -> adenylyl cyclase -> cAMP -> protein kinase A -> phosphorylation

While insulin promotes synthesis:

* Insulin binds to tyrosine kinase receptor
* Binding activates phosphatase
    * removes phosphates from phosphorylase and phosphorylase kinase
    * removal of phosphate deactivates phosphorylase
* Also activates phosphodiesterase (which degrades cAMP)
    * opposes effects of glucagon and epinephrine
* Degradation is decreased

>*Basically: Glucagon and epinephrine promote degradation, insulin decreases it*


### **Allosteric**

Glycogenesis is stimulated when substrate availability and energy levels are high. Glycogenolysis is increased when glucose and energy levels are low.

Allosteric regulation allows a rapid response to the needs of a cell, and can override the effects of hormone-mediated regulation.

* G-6-P allosterically inhibits phoshorylase
* ATP allosterically inhibits phosphorylase
    * ATP indicates high energy, no need for degradation
* In muscles also AMP activates phosphorylase
    * AMP needs muscle is exercising
    * thus need for degradation
* Ca2+ activates phosphorylase kinase
    * muscles release Ca2+ during contraction
    * liver releases Ca2+ during epinephrine release (fight or flight)
    * Ca 2+ binds to calmodulin
        * Ca2+ calmodulin complex activates phosphorylase kinase
        * (no need for PKA)
* G-6-P activates glycogen synthase
