## **Overview**
---
Glycolysis is a metabolic pathway, meaning that the product of one rxn is the substrate of the next. Glycolysis does not require oxygen.

* It is the breaking down of glucose to pyruvate
    * (thus the name glyco-lysis)
* It is a universal pathway found in all cell types
* Generates ATP
* Does not require oxygen
* Anabolic pathway
    * (constructs molecules from smaller units)

Glycolysis is made up of 2 "phases". An "energy-requiring" phase that uses ATP, and an "energy-releasing" phase that generates ATP.

Although the first "energy-requiring" step uses ATP, it is an "investment" to yield more ATP later on.

## **Steps**
---

### **Energy-Requiring Phase**

This phase requires ATP to get going. It is an "investment" of ATP to yield more later on.

It includes 5 major steps:

**Step 1**
* A phosphate group is transferred from ATP to glucose, making glucose-6-phosphate.
* Glucose-6-phosphate is more reactive than glucose
* Step uses enzyme and ATP
* Enzyme is either hexokinase or glucokinase
    * hexokinase and glucokinase cannot reverse the rxn after it occurs


| |Hexokinase|Glucokinase|
|:--:|:--:|:--:|
|**Occurence**|in all tissues|in liver|
|**Km**| <0.02 mM|10-20 mM|
|**Specificity**| gluc, fruct, man, gal| glucose|
|**Induction**|not induced| high insulin, glucose|
|**Function**|at any glucose level|only >100mg/dl|

* hexokinase is a general enzyme that works for hexoses (fructose, galactose, etc.)
    * low Km, high affinity
    * functions at any glucose level
    * not induced/"activated" by a hormonal stimulus
<!-- -->
* glucokinase is a glucose-specific enzyme
    * high affinity, low Km
    * induced/activated by high glucose and insulin amounts (insulin increases with glucose)

> *remember that glocokinase and hexokinase cannot reverse the rxn*
<!-- -->

\
**Step 2**
* Glucose-6-phosphate is converted into its isomer, fructose-6-phosphate.
    * "isomerization"
* uses phosphoglucose isomerase
    * (because it isomerizes phospho-glucose)

**Step 3**
* A phosphate group is transferred from ATP to fructose-6-phosphate, producing fructose-1,6-bisphosphate.
    * (uses ATP)
* Catalyzed phosphofructo-kinase enzyme, which can be regulated to speed up or slow down the glycolysis pathway.
    * phosphofructo-kinase enzyme cannot reverse the rxn
* Considered the "rate limiting step" of the pathway" (i.e: slowest)

**Step 4**
* Fructose-1,6-bisphosphate splits into two 3-carbon sugars: dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P).
    * they are isomers, but only G3P can directly continue through the next steps of glycolysis.

**Step 5**
* DHAP is isomerized into G3P.
* Carried out by triose-phosphate isomerase.
    * enzyme can reverse the rxn.

> *the enzyme names are very easy once you understand the steps, enzyme names are self-explanatory (i.e: glucose is isomerized into glucose phosphate using the enzyme phosphoglucose isomerase)*

> *Go back to the image of glycolysis and look at what is above the dashed line, try to match it up with the steps. If you draw it and write it enough times, you will remember it.*

So far, 2 ATP molecules have been used in steps 1 and 3 (phosphate taken from ATP). We also yielded two G3P molecules.

### **Energy-Releasing Phase**

In the second half of glycolysis, the three-carbon sugars formed in the first half of the process go through a series of additional transformations, ultimately turning into pyruvate.

In the process, four ATP molecules are produced, along with two molecules of NADH.

**Step 6**
* Two rxns occur simultaneously
    * glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (G3P) is oxidized by dehydrogenase
    * NAD+ is reduced into NADH and H+
* Basically, H is taken from G3P and given to NAD
* Rxn is exergonic, the energy released from it is then used to phosphorylate the molecule
* Results in 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate

**Step 7**
* 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate donates phosphate to ADP, resulting in 3-phosphoglycerate
* ADP is converted into ATP
* Catalyzed by phospoglycerate kinase

**Step 8**
* 3-phosphoglycerate isomerized into 2-phosphoglycerate
* Catalyzed by mutase

**Step 9**
* 2-phosphoglycerate is dehydrated (loses a molecule of water), becoming phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP)
* Catalyzed by enolase

**Step 10**
* PEP donates a phosphate group to ADP, resulting in a second molecule of ATP.
* Catalyzed by pyruvate kinase
* With the loss of the phosphate, PEP is converted to pyruvate (end product of glycolysis)

|Step|First Result|Second Result|Enzyme|
|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
|6|glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (G3P) --> 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate|NAD+ --> NADH|dehydrogenase|
|7|1,3-bisphosphoglycerate --> 3-phosphoglycerate|ADP --> ATP|phospoglycerate kinase|
|8|3-phosphoglycerate --> 2-phosphoglycerate||mutase|
|9|2-phosphoglycerate --> PEP||enolase|
|10|PEP --> pyruvate|ADP --> ATP|pyruvate kinase|

Note that the energy-releasing phase occurs twice for each G3P molecule that was produced  in the energy-requiring phase.

### **Final Results**

So to sum up glycolysis: 2 ATP are used, but 4 are produced. The net result is a gain of 2 ATPs. The final product is 2 pyruvates, 2 NADH, and 4 ATP.

### **Rapaport Luberent Shunt**

In RBCs, glycolysis is a bit different. There is a quick "detour" in the steps.

* Normally: step 7 converts 1,3-BPG directly into 3-phosphoglycerate.
* In RBCs: "detour" first isomerizes 1,3-BPG into 2,3-BPG via mutase.
    * no production of ATP

This "detour" skips an ATP-producing step. The reason is that 2,3-BPG is extremely important for the functioning of hemoglobin and the release of oxygen.

* 2,3 BPG binds to deoxyhemoglobin (hemoglobin without bound oxygen)
* decreases affinity towards oxygen, inhibiting rebinding of oxygen
    * (oxygen is released without rebinding to hemoglobin)

The benefits of producing 2,3-BPG outweigh the drawbacks of a decreased ATP yield.

## **Regulation**
---

Regulation mainly occurs on the 3 irreversible steps:

* Step 1: glucose –> glucose-6-P (glucokinase and hexokinase)
* Step 3: fructose-6-P –> fructose-1,6-biP (phosphofructokinase)
* Step 10: PEP --> pyruvate (pyruvate kinase)

For now, know that glycolysis activators are inhibitors of gluconeogenesis, and vice versa.

### **PFK and PK**

* Phosphofructokinase
    * Inhibitors
        * **ATP:** high amounts indicates high energy state, no need for glycolysis
        * **Citrate:** high amounts indicate high Krebs cycle activity, no need for glycolysis
        * **Protons (H+):** high amounts indicate high ETC activity
    * Activators
        * **f-2,6-biP**
        * **AMP**
<!-- -->
* Pyruvate Kinase
    * Inhibitors
        * **Alanine:** can act as a source of pyruvate, so no need for glycolysis
        * **ATP:** high amounts indicates high energy state
    * Activators
        * **fructose-1,6-biP**

> *notice how glycolysis activators are also inhibitors of gluconeogenesis, and vice versa*

### **Glucokinase**

During low glucose levels, glucokinase is sequestered in the nucleus and bound to glucokinase regulatory protein (GKRP). When bound to GKRP, it is inactive and remains in neucleus.

* High glucose concentration (induced by insulin) leads to glucokinase released into cytosol
* high f-6-p (due to increased glycolysis) leads to sequestration of glucokinase back to the nucleus (becomes inactive again)

### **Hormonal Regulation**

The two main hormones that affect glycolysis are insulin and glucagon.

* Insluin under a well-fed state.
* Glucagon under fasting condition.

Thus, insulin is what activates the three regulated and irreversible steps of glycolysis, while glucagon inhibits them.

### **External Inhibitors**

Main ones: Arsenic, Flouride

* Flouride inhibits enolase (inorganic inhibitor)
* Flouridated water inhibits bacterial enolase leading to less dental cavities
<!-- -->
* Pentavalent Arsenic (arsenate) competes with phosphate as a substrate for G3P (step 6)
* Trivalent arsenic (arsenite) acts on pyruvate dehydrogenase (which converts pyruvate to acetyl CoA)
    * affects krebs cycle.

Arsenite is much more dangerous than arsenate, as arsenite affects Krebs cycle.
