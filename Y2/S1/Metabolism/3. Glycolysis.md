## **Overview**
---
Glycolysis is a metabolic pathway, meaning that the product of one rxn is the substrate of the next.

* It is the breaking down of glucose to pyruvate
    * (thus the name glyco-lysis)
* It is a universal pathway found in all cell types
* Generates ATP
* Does not require oxygen
* Anabolic pathway
    * (constructs molecules from smaller units)

Glycolysis is made up of 2 "phase". An "energy-requiring" phase that uses ATP, and an "energy-releasing" phase that generates ATP.

Although the first "energy-requiring" step uses ATP, it is an "investment" to yield more ATP later on.

## **Steps**
---

### **Energy-Requiring Phase**

This phase requires ATP to get going. It is an "investment" of ATP to yield more later on.

It includes 5 major steps:

**Step 1**
* A phosphate group is transferred from ATP to glucose, making glucose-6-phosphate.
* Glucose-6-phosphate is more reactive than glucose
* Step uses enzyme and ATP
* Enzyme is either hexokinase or glucokinase
    * hexokinase and glucokinase cannot reverse the rxn after it occurs


| |Hexokinase|Glucokinase|
|:--:|:--:|:--:|
|**Occurence**|in all tissues|in liver|
|**Km**| <0.02 mM|10-20 mM|
|**Specificity**| gluc, fruct, man, gal| glucose|
|**Induction**|not induced| high insulin, glucose|
|**Function**|at any glucose level|only >100mg/dl|

* hexokinase is a general enzyme that works for hexoses (fructose, galactose, etc.)
    * low Km, high affinity
    * functions at any glucose level
    * not induced/"activated" by a hormonal stimulus
<!-- -->
* glucokinase is a glucose-specific enzyme
    * high affinity, low Km
    * induced/activated by high glucose and insulin amounts (insulin increases with glucose)

> *remember that glocokinase and hexokinase cannot reverse the rxn*
<!-- -->

\
**Step 2**
* Glucose-6-phosphate is converted into its isomer, fructose-6-phosphate.
    * "isomerization"
* uses phosphoglucose isomerase
    * (because it isomerizes phospho-glucose

**Step 3**
* A phosphate group is transferred from ATP to fructose-6-phosphate, producing fructose-1,6-bisphosphate.
    * (uses ATP)
* Catalyzed phosphofructo-kinase enzyme, which can be regulated to speed up or slow down the glycolysis pathway.
    * phosphofructo-kinase enzyme cannot reverse the rxn
* Considered the "rate limiting step" of the pathway" (i.e: slowest)

**Step 4**
* Fructose-1,6-bisphosphate splits into two 3-carbon sugars: dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (GAP).
    * they are isomers, but only GAP can directly continue through the next steps of glycolysis.

**Step 5**
* DHAP is isomerized into GAP.
* Carried out by triose-phosphate isomerase.
    * enzyme can reverse the rxn.

|Step|Enzyme|Result|Uses ATP?|
|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
|1|hexokinase or glucokinase|glucose ---> glucose-6-P| Yes|
|2|phosphoglucose isomerase| glucose-6-P --> fructose-6-P||
|3|phosphofructo-kinase|fructose-6-P --> fructose-1,6-biP| Yes|
|4|fructose biphosphate aldose|fructose-1,6-biP --> DAHP + GAP||
|5|triose-phosphate isomerase|DHAP --> GAP||

> *the enzyme names are very easy once you understand the steps, enzyme names are self-explanatory (i.e: glucose is isomerized into glucose phosphate using the enzyme phosphoglucose isomerase)*

> *Go back to the image of glycolysis and look at what is above the dashed line, try to match it up with the steps. If you draw it and write it enough times, you will remember it.*

So far, 2 ATP molecules have been used in steps 1 and 3 (phosphate taken from ATP).
