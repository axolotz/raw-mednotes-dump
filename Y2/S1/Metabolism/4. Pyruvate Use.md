## **Overview**
---

Glycolysis produced pyruvate molecules. That pyruvate can now be used up via a number of different pathways.

If there is oxygen, pyruvate goes through aerobic respiration (oxygen-requiring) to yield even more ATP.

If there is a lack of oxygen it will go through anaerobic pathways (non-oxygen requiring), where glycolysis is repeated over and over to become the major source for ATP.

There are 4 major pathways that pyruvate could go through:

* pyruvate decarboxilation (aka pyruvate oxidation)
* Carboxylation to oxaloacetate
* Lactic acid fermentation
* Ethanol fermentation

## **Anaerobic Respiration**
---

If oxygen is present, pyruvate goes through more processes to yield a large amount of ATP. If there is a lack of oxygen, glycolysis becomes the main source for ATP.

Fermentation is an anaerobic (non-oxygen-requiring) pathway meant to produce ATP without the use of oxygen.

Fermentation relies on the net gain of 2 ATP molecules from glycolysis as a source of energy. It recycles glycolysis products in order for the process to occur again to yield 2 more ATPs.

Fermentation pathways consist of glycolysis with some extra rxns added to them. In yeast, the extra reactions make alcohol, while in your muscles, they make lactic acid.

### **Ethanol fermentation**

Yeasts perform this conversion in the absence of oxygen. Pyruvate is converted into ethanol. This is also sometimes called "alcohol fermentation"

Going from pyruvate to ethanol is a two-step process.

1. Pyruvate --> acetaldehyde
    * via pyruvate decarboxylase
<!-- -->
2. Acetaldehyde --> ethanol
    * via alcohol dehydrogenase

This is why yeast rises when sugar is added to it. The yeast produces CO2 when decarboxolating the pyruvate into acetaldehyde.

### **Lactic Acid Fermentation**

This is what occurs in humans.

* Pyruvate --> lactate
* Via lactate dehydrogenase
* Two-way rxn

|*lactic acid fermentation*|

* occurs in order to survive brief hypoxia (low oxygen level in tissues)
* occurs in high energy demand of rigorously exercising muscles
* occurs in cells with low energy demand
    * e.g: RBCs (also because they don't have mitochondrion)


**Lactic acidosis** is the most common cause for metabolic acidosis, occurs due to accumulation of lactic acid.

Common causes of lactic acidosis are:

* Lactate overproduction or underutilization
* Hypoxia
* Impaired O2 transport
* Uncontrolled hemorrhage
* Direct inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation
* Decrease in pyruvate dehydrogenase (no production of acetyl-CoA)
* Decrease in Krebs cycle activity (acetyl-CoA underused)
