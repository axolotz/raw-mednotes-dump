## **Overview**
---
Krebs cycle, (also called citric acid cycle or tricarboxylic acid "TCA" cycle).

* Occurs in mitochondria
* Aerobic pathway (depends on oxygen)
* 8 rxns, 8 enzymes
* No oxygen is introduced, but two CO2 exit
    * citric acid (first molecule) has 6 carbons, oxaloacetate (last molecule) has 4
    * 2 carbons are lost

## **Steps**
---

Before the cycle begins:

* Pyruvate is transported into mitochondria
* Pyruvate -> acetyl CoA
    * via pyruvate dehydrogenase complex
* Acetyl CoA is the 2 carbon substrate for the TCA cycle


> *From here, a good way to remember the steps is using the mnemonic:

Can I keep selling soup for money, Officer?*

**Step 1**
* acetyl CoA (2C) + oxaloacetate (4C) -> citrate (6C)
* Enzyme: citrate synthase
    * activators: Ca2+, ADP
    * inhibitors: ATP, NADH, succinyl CoA, citrate
    * primary regulation is substrate availability

**Step 2**
* citrate (6C) -> isocitrate (6C)
* Enzyme: aconitase
    * inhibitors: flouroacetate (found in rat poison)

**Step 3**
* isocitrate (6C) → α-ketoglutarate (5C)
* Enzyme: isocitrate dehydrogenase
    * activators: Ca2+, ADP
    * inhibitors: ATP, NADH
* Produces NADH and CO2
* One of the rate-limiting steps

>*note: wherever there is a dehydrogenase in this cycle, there is a release of NADH or FADH2 (because a hydrogen is removed)*

**Step 4**
* α-ketoglutarate (5C) -> succinyl CoA (4C)
* Enzyme: α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex (enzyme complex)
    * activators: Ca2+
    * inhibitors: ATP, NADH, succinyl CoA
* Required coenzymes: thiamine pyrophosphate, lipoic acid, FAD
* Produces NADH and CO2

>*up to now the cycle was getting rid of the 2 carbons, from now on the cycle regenerates the oxaloacetate*

**Step 5**
* succinyl CoA (4C) → succinate (4C)
* Enzyme: succinate thiokinase
    * cleaves thioster bond of succinyl CoA
* Generates GTP (GDP phosphorylated to GTP)

**Step 6**
* succinate -> fumarate
* Enzyme: succinate dehydrogenase
    * inhibitors: oxaloacetate
* Produces FADH2

**Step 7**
* fumarate -> malate
* Enzyme: fumarase

**Step 8**
* malate -> oxaloacetate
    * secondary alcohol -> ketone
* Enzyme: malate dehydrogenase
* Produces NADH
