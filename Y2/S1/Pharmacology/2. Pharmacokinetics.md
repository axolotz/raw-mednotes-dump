## **Overview**
---

Pharmokinetics is the effect of the body on drugs (i.e: what the body does to the drug).

<mark>Pharmacokinetics is the study of drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME).</mark>

* Goal is to reach a desired beneficial effect with minimal adverse effects possible.
    * clinician must determine the dose that most closely achieves this
* There is a relationship between the drug's effect and its concentration at the active site

General rule: any adverse effects that can be prevented should be prevented.

## **Permeation**
---

Drug permeation proceeds by four primary mechanisms

* Lipid Diffusion
* Aqueous Diffusion

Passive diffusion in an aqueous or lipid medium is common, but there are also active processes involved in the movement of many drugs, especially
those whose molecules are too large to diffuse readily.

### **Lipid Diffusion**

Most important mechanism of permeation. It is a passive process.

* drug must cross phospholipid membranes in order to reach active site
* the more lipid soluble it is, the easier it is to pass through membranes
* driven by concentration gradient (passive)

* prof mentioned that diffusing drug molecules in the body are continously washed away by circulating blood.
    * thus, there is always a concentration gradient and never any equilibrium

#### **Fick's Law of Diffusion**
The passive flux (movement through a membrane) of molecules down a concentration gradient is given by Fick's Law:

    Flux (molecules/unit time) =
    C1 - C2 * [(area * permeability coefficient) / thickness]

Where:

* C1 is the higher concentration
* C2 is the lower concentration
* area is the area across which diffusion occurs
* permeability coefficient is a measure of the mobility of drug molecules in the medium of the diffusion path (constant)
* thickness is the thickness or length of diffusion path
    * thicker membrane = lower flux
    * thinner membrane = higher flux

#### **Water and Lipid Solubility**
* Lipid diffusion depends on high lipid solubility (ability to cross bilayer membrane)
* Water soluble substances (i.e: ionized, polar, charged) are not lipid-soluble
    * they attract water molecules around them (water shell around them), making them unable to cross the hydrophobic part of the bilayer
* Thus, ionization of drugs (becoming water soluble) may reduce their ability to permeate membranes

<!-- -->
* Ionization of the drug is determined by the drug's pKa and the medium's pH
    * Most drugs are either weak acids or weak bases
    * Weak acid in an acidic medium (or base in basic medium) will not be ionized (can cross bilayer)
    * However, acid in basic medium or vice versa leads to ionization (cannot cross bilayer, no absorption)

> *remember that pKa is the pH where a drug is 50% ionized (lipid-insoluble, non-absorbable), and 50% non-ionized (lipid-soluble, absorbable)*

If the pKa of the drug and the pH of the medium are known, the fraction of molecules in the ionized state can be predicted by means of the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:


### **Aqueous Diffusion**

Passive movement of molecules through the watery intracellular and extracellular spaces.

* via capillary membranes with small water-filled pores
* Occurs within larger aqueous compartments of the body (Interstitial space, cytosol, etc).
* driven by concentration gradient
