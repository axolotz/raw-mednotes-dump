## **Overview**
---

Pharmacodynamics is the effect of the drugs on the body (biochemical and physiological).

Most drugs exert their effect by interacting with specialized target macromolecules called receptors. Binding with receptor will cause conformational changes or a biochemical effect.

* Receptors determine specificity of drug
* Most are proteins
* Most drugs bind reversibly (non-covelant)
* Not all drugs use receptors

Two fundamental properties underly specificity in drug-receptor interactions:

* Complementarity of shape between drug and receptor (lock and key model)
* complementarity in electrostatic, hydrophobic, and hydrogen bonding surfaces of each component

|*lock and key model*|

Recognition sites are molecular regions of the receptor to which ligands bind to

Drug-receptor interactions are:

* Saturable
* Competitive
* Specific and selective


## **Drug-Receptor Interactions**
---

<!-- -->
The major receptor families are:
* **Ligand-gated ion channels**
    * responsible for regulation of the flow of ions channels across cell membranes
    * regulated binding of a ligand to the channels
    * e.g: nicotinic receptor, where binding acetylcholine results in sodium influx and the activation of contraction in skeletal muscle
<!-- -->
* **G protein-coupled receptors**
    * on the inner face of the plasma membrane
    * regulate effector proteins via group of GTP proteins known as G proteins
    * e.g: some hormone peptide receptors and neurotransmitter receptors
    * adrenergic and muscarinic receptors depend on the G proteins
<!-- -->
* **Enzyme-linked receptors**
    * ligand binding activates or inhibits the related cytosolic enzyme
    * most common are receptors with tyrosine kinase activity as part of their structure
        * binding results phosphorylation of tyrosine residues of specific protein
        * addition of phosphate group can modify the 3D structure of target protein
<!-- -->
* **Intercellular receptors**
    * ligand must diffuse into the cell
    * ligand must have sufficient lipid solubilities (to be able to move)
    * e.g: steroids hormones, where activated ligand-receptor complex migrates to nucleus

### **Antagonists**

An antagonist is a drug that binds to a receptor and prevents the agonist from binding (i.e: stops the action or effect of another substance).

* Some compounds bind to cell surface receptors without activating it
* The compound prevents the binding of endogenous agonist
* The compound is said to "antagonize" or "block" the receptor
    * known as "receptor antagonist"
<!-- -->
* If the binding is reversible: "competitive antagonists"
* If binding is irreversible: "noncompetitive antagonists"
<!-- -->
* Most antagonists bind to the binding site
* Some antagonists can also bind to a remote site on receptor
    * causes change in receptor that prevents endogenous agonist
    * causes "allosteric" effect
* Considered noncompetitive antagonist

Some examples:

* Antagonize cell surface receptors
    * Angiotensin Receptor Blockers (ARBs) for high BP, heart failure, chronic renal insufficiency
    * Beta Adrenoceptor Blockers for angina, myocardial infarction, heart failure, high BP, performance anxienty
<!-- -->
* Antagonize nuclear receptors
    * Mineralocorticoid Receptor Antagonists for edema due to liver cirrhosis and for heart failure
    * Estrogen Receptor Antagonists for prevention and treatment of breast cancer
<!-- -->
* Enzyme inhibitors
    * Cyclooxygenaase inhibitor for pain relief (e.g: aspirin, ibuprofen)
<!-- -->
* Ion channel blockers
    * Sodium channel blockers can help suppress cardiac arrythmias (e.g: licodaine)
<!-- -->
* Inhibit transporters
    * Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) (e.g: fluoxetine, aka Prozac)
    * Inhibitors of Na-2Cl-K Symporter to increase urine and sodium output for the treatment of edema
<!-- -->
* Inhibitors of Signal Transduction Proteins
    * Tyrosine kinase inhibitors for chronic myelocytic leukemia
    * Type 5 phosphodiesterase inhibitors for erectile dysfunction (e.g: sildenafil, aka viagra)

### **Agonists**

* Some chemicals bind to cell surface receptors and trigger a response
    * called "receptor agonists"
* Some agonists are actually the endogenous chemical signal, while others only mimic it
* They agonize receptors, open channels, and activate enzymes
* e.g: morphine agonists

### **Unconvential Mechanisms of Action**

Some drugs use unconvential mechanisms of action.

* Disrupting structural proteins
    * e.g: colchicine for gout
<!-- -->
* Being enzymes
    * e.g: streptokinase for thrombolysis
<!-- -->
* Covelantly linking to macromolecules
<!-- -->
* Reacting chemically with small molecules
    * e.g: antacids for increased acidity
<!-- -->
* Binding free molecules or atoms
    * e.g: drugs for heavy metal poisoning, anti-TNF
<!-- -->
* Being nutrients
    * e.g: calcium supplements
<!-- -->
* Being antigens
    * e.g: vaccines
<!-- -->
* Exert actions due to physical properties
    * e.g: laxatives
<!-- -->
* Unkown mechanism
    * e.g: general anesthetics

## **Receptor Occupancy**
---

Activation of membrane receptors and target cell responses is proportional to the degree of receptor occupancy.

Assuming that:

* All receptors are equally accessible
* All receptors are either free or bound, there is no “partial” binding
* Neither drug nor receptor are altered by binding
* Binding is reversible

Dissasociation constant Kd indicates the strength of binding between R and D in terms of how easy it is to separate the DR complex.

Hill Langmuir equation:

    B / Bmax = D / (D + Kd)

* B: bound receptor
* Bmax: maximum number of bound receptors
* Kd: dissasociation constant

Kd is the concentration at which binding sites are 50% occupied.

* Receptor's affinity for binding determines concentration of drug required
* Total number of receptors is usually much smaller than the number of drug molecules
* This limits the maximal effect a drug may produce (limited by number of receptors on the cell)

## **Graduate Dose-Response Relationship**
---

Receptor occupancy is about the number of receptors occupied, while dose-response is about the response of the drug.
<!-- -->
* As the dose increases, so does the pharmacologic effect
* At a certain dose, the effect reaches a maximum level (Emax)
    * No increase in effect after Emax
    * Emax is not equal to Bmax (not all receptors need to be occupied to reach max effect)

|![](https://basicmedicalkey.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/bg000500003.jpg)|
|:-:|

* ED50 is 50% of the dose that gives Emax
* EC50 is 50% of the dose that gives Emax

As seen in the graph above, ED50 can come before Kd (concentration at which binding sites are 50% occupied). This is due to signal amplification and spare receptors.

### **Signal Amplification**

For example with GCPRs:
* Receptor-drug complex can interact with many G proteins thereby multiply the organ signal
* Activated G protein persists longer than the original drug-receptor complex

### **Spare Receptors**

Only a fraction of total receptors may need to be occupied to elicit a maximum response.

For example:

* Insulin has a large functional reserve of spare receptors
    * to ensure adequate control of glucose uptake
<!-- -->
* only 5-10% of beta adrenoceptors are spare
    * little functional reserve
    * most receptors are needed to be occupied for maximum effect

## **Potency**
---

* Potency refers to the amount or concentration of drug required to produce a response.
* Measured on the x-axis in a dose-response curve.
* ED50, EC50, and Kd are measures of potency.
    * the smaller the EC50 (or ED50), the greater the potency.

It is a term used whenever we compare the activity of two drugs that produce the same effect.

Defined as the dose of one drug necessary to produce a specific response as compared to a second drug producing the same effect.

|*drug A is more potent as it has a lower ED50*|

## **Efficacy**
---

Efficacy is the maximum effect of the drug, or Emax.

* Depends on number of drug-receptor complexes formed.
* Also depends on efficiency of coupling of receptor activation to cellular responses.
* i.e: aspirin and morphine produce the same pharmologic effect, but differ in efficacy.
