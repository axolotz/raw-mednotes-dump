## **Overview**
---

Pharmacokinetics is the effect of the body on drugs (i.e: what the body does to the drug).

<mark>Pharmacokinetics is the study of drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME).</mark>

* Goal is to reach a desired beneficial effect with minimal adverse effects possible.
    * clinician must determine the dose that most closely achieves this
* There is a relationship between the drug's effect and its concentration at the active site

General rule: any adverse effects that can be prevented should be prevented.

## **Permeation**
---

Drug permeation via passive diffusion in an aqueous or lipid medium is common, but there are also active processes involved in the movement of many drugs, especially
those whose molecules are too large to diffuse readily.

Drug permeation proceeds by four primary mechanisms

* Lipid Diffusion
* Aqueous Diffusion
* Special Carriers
* Endocytosis and Excocytosis

### **Lipid Diffusion**

Most important mechanism of permeation. It is a passive process.

* drug must cross phospholipid membranes in order to reach active site
* the more lipid soluble it is, the easier it is to pass through membranes
* driven by concentration gradient (passive)

|*movement down a concenration gradient*|

> *prof mentioned that diffusing drug molecules in the body are continously washed away by circulating blood. Thus, there is always a concentration gradient and never any equilibrium.*


* Lipid diffusion relies on high lipid solubility (ability to cross bilayer membrane)
* Water soluble substances (i.e: ionized, polar, charged) are not lipid-soluble
    * they attract water molecules around them (water shell around them), making them unable to cross the hydrophobic part of the bilayer
<!-- -->
* Thus, ionization of drugs (becoming water soluble) may reduce their ability to permeate membranes
* Ionization of the drug is determined by the drug's pKa and the medium's pH
    * Most drugs are either weak acids or weak bases
    * Weak acid in an acidic medium (or base in basic medium) will not be ionized (can cross bilayer)
    * However, acid in basic medium or vice versa leads to ionization (cannot cross bilayer, no absorption)

> *remember that pKa is the pH where a drug is 50% ionized (lipid-insoluble, non-absorbable), and 50% non-ionized (lipid-soluble, absorbable)*

If the pKa of the drug and the pH of the medium are known, the fraction of molecules in the ionized state can be predicted by means of the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

    pKa - pH = log (protonated/unprotonated)

For example:

Pyrimethamine as a weak base drug with a pKa of 7.0. What is the proportion of ionized and unionized drug in blood (pH = 7.4)?

     pKa - pH = log (protonated/unprotonated)

    7.0 - 7.4 = log (protonated/unprotonated)
         -0.4 = log (protonated/unprotonated)
        10^-4 = (protonated/unprotonated)
        10^-4 = 0.4/1

So for every 0.4 protonated molecules, there is 1 unprotonated molecule. The unionized form of this drug predominates.

> *remember that bases are ionized when protonated, while acids are ionized when unprotonated*

We can also represent this as a portion of the total number of molecules (ionized+unionized):

    ionized/total = 0.4/(0.4 + 1) = 0.4/1.4

Prof. said that at the end you need to use whole numbers (since there are no "0.4 molecules"). So multiply everything by 5 to get a whole number.

These principles can be used to help excrete a drug faster (in case of overdose)

* Acidic drug can be excreted faster via alkalinization of urine
    * urine can be alkalinized by sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3)
* Basic drug can be excreted faster via acification of urine
    * urine can be acidified via ascorbic acid (vitamin C) or ammonium chloride (NH4Cl)

### **Aqueous Diffusion**

Passive movement of molecules through the watery intracellular and extracellular spaces.

* Via capillary membranes with small water-filled pores
* Occurs within larger aqueous compartments of the body (interstitial space, cytosol, etc).
* Driven by concentration gradient
* Drugs bound to plasma proteins cannot permeate aqueous pores
* Flux is influenced by electrical fields if drug is charged


### **Special Carriers**

* For important substances that are too large or lipid insoluble (cannot passively diffuse)
    * e.g: peptides, amino acids, glucose, etc.
* Drug movement is done via active transport or facilitated diffusion
* Selective, saturable, inhibitable
<!-- -->
Some cells contain less selective carriers specialized for expelling foreign molecules, these include:
* ATP-binding cassette (ABC family)
    * p-glycoprotein or MDR1
        * found in brain, testes, and some drug-resistant neoplastic cells
    * MRP (multidrug-resistance associated proteins)
        * plays role in exretion of some drugs or their metabolites into urine and bile
        * mediate resistance of some tumors to chemotherapeutic agents
* SLC (solute carrier)
    * use ion gradients for energy
    * important in transport or uptake of neurotrasmmitters in nerve endings

### **Endocytosis & Excocytosis**

Some substances are so large or impermeant that they can only enter cells by endocytosis.

* Responsible for transport of vitamin B12 (complexed with intrinsic factor) across wall of gut into blood
* Responsible for transport of iron associated with transferrin into RBCs
<!-- -->
* Excocytosis is responsible for secretion of many substances
    * e.g: neurotransmitters and some hormones

|*endocytosis*

### **Fick's Law of Diffusion**
The passive flux (movement through a membrane) of molecules down a concentration gradient is given by Fick's Law:

    Flux (molecules/unit time) =
    C1 - C2 * [(area * permeability coefficient) / thickness]

Where:

* C1 is the higher concentration
* C2 is the lower concentration
* area is the area across which diffusion occurs
* permeability coefficient is a measure of the mobility of drug molecules in the medium of the diffusion path (constant)
* thickness is the thickness or length of diffusion path
    * thicker membrane = lower flux
    * thinner membrane = higher flux

### **Barriers Against Permeation**

* Tight junctions between endothelial cells and absence of pores
* Presence of thick basement membrane
* Presence of connective tissue cells around endothelial cells
    * e.g: astrocytes in the brain
* Presence of drug export pumps
* Enzymes that metabolize drugs
    * e.g: endothelial cells of brain (blood-brain-barrier), also testis
<!-- -->
* Placental barrier
    * semi-permeable membrane made up of placental tissues
    * maternal and fetal circulations are completely separated
    * tight junctions
        * allow passage of ions and small molecules
        * restrict movement of larger molecules and certain drugs

## **Bioavailability**
---

Bioavailability is the percentage or fraction of the unchanged active drug which reaches the systemic circulation of the patient.

Bioavailability is equal to "1" or 100% following IV adminsteration. It may be less than 1 after oral adminstration, this is due to:

* first pass effect
* incomplete disintegration and dissolution
* destruction of drug within GIT lumen by gastric acid, bacteria, etc.
* faulty manufacturing of dosage form
* enterohepatic cycling
* incomplete absorption
    * too hydrophobic (cannot cross water near the bilayer)
    * reverse transporters pumping drug back into gut lumen (e.g: p-glycoprotein)
        * can be inhibited with drugs or grapefruit juice
        * grapefruit also inhibits presystemic elimination of some drugs (increases bioavailibility)

Portion of unchanged active drug that reaches systemic circulation is the "bioavailable" portion of the dose.

### **First Pass Effect**

Drugs absorbed from GI tract must first pass through the liver before reaching systemic circulation.

Intestine -> gut wall -> portal vein -> liver -> hepatic vein -> inferior vena cava -> systemic circulation

* Drug may be metabolized in gut wall, portal vein, and liver prior to entering systemic circulation
* May also be excreted by liver through bile
* Occurs in orally given drugs
* Does not occur in IV (drug reaches circulation directly in IV)

This all leads to incomplete delivery of the dose to the systemic circulation. This process is called “first-pass effect” or
“first-pass metabolism” or “pre-systemic elimination”.

|![](https://www.hempurecbd.com/product_images/uploaded_images/infographic-first-fast-01-768x384.png)|
|:-:|
|*first pass effect*|

* Therapeutic blood concentration can be reached by using a larger dose (for oral doses)
    * thus, oral dose is usually higher than the IV dose for such drugs
<!-- -->
* Patient with liver cirrhosis may have shunting of the blood bypassing portal circulation
    * larger oral dose may be toxic

Effect of first-pass hepatic elimination on bioavailability can be expressed as the "extraction ratio" (ER):

    ER = liver clearance / blood flow to river

* Blood flow to liver is normally 90 L/hour in a healthy 70kg man

> *prof. said you have to know the 90 L/hour value, it will not come on the exam*

Bioavailability (F) can be predicted from extent of absorption (f) and ER.

    F = f * (1 - ER)


Drugs with high ER have high interindividual variation in bioavailability due to differences among individuals in hepatic blood flow and drug metabolism.

>*remember: high ER = high interindividual variation

### **Plasma Concentration vs Time**

Bioavailability may be measured via "area under curve".

|![](https://pharmaeducation.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/plasma-level-time-curve-1.jpg)|
|:-:|
|*plasma concentration vs time curve for an orally administered drug*|

* Absorption phase: absorption rate is higher than elimination rate
* Elimination phase: elimination rate is higher than absorption rate
* Cmax: absorption rate = elimination rate
* Tmax: time to reach Cmax
* MEC: minimal effective concentration
* MTC: minimal toxic concentration
* Onset (lag) time: time before onset of action

>*some graphs include "TC" which refers to "thereapeutic concentration", it does not mean "toxic concentration"*
<!-- -->
* Blow the MEC, the drug no longer produces the desired pharmacologic response.
    * frequency of adminstration of some drugs depends on this
    * i.e: drug that goes below MEC every 12 hours might be adminstered every 12 hours or so, so that it stays above the MEC

To calculate extent and rate of bioavailability:

    extent of bioavailability = area under curve
    rate of bioavailability = Cmax / Tmax

### **Bioequivalence**

Bioequivalence is used to compare the extent and rate of absorption of two different formulations of the same active drug. If two products are said to be bioequivalent it means that they would be expected to be the same.

Two products are said to be equivelent when the extent and rate of bioavailability are similar.

A difference in one of these factors means that the two products are not bioequivalent.

|*concentration vs time of different formulations of the same drug*|

### **Enterohepatic Cycling**

After oral administration, a drug can be excreted in bile before reaching system circulation, go back to the lumen, and get reabsorbed again.

* It is the recirculation of compounds between the liver and intestines
* Many compounds are released in bile, reabsorbed in SI, and then return to the liver

|![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/17/Enterohepatic.svg/269px-Enterohepatic.svg.png)|
|:-:|
|*enterohepatic circulation*|

* Enterohepatic cycling reduces bioavailability
* Enterohepatic cycling prolongs half-life of elimination
<!-- -->
* Can be taken advantage of in case of overdose
    * patient given activated charcoal
    * activated charcoal absorbs many drugs and chemicals (except ionized ones)
    * charcoal binds to ingested drug in the gut before it can be absorbed
    * accelerates excretion

## **Volume of Distribution**
---

Observed concentration of drug immediatly after IV adminstration may be used to estimate the total volume into which the drug distributes.

It is the ratio of amount of drug in body (dose) to concentration of that drug measured in blood.

>*prof. gave this example: if you add 100 mg of a drug into a water bucket, then measure the drug concentration after the drug gets distributed, you can then calculate the total volume of the bucket*

* Vd reflects the apparent space available for the drug
* It does NOT represent a real volume
    * because it assumes that drug is evenly distributed
    * also because the plasma does not accurately represent the whole body

<!-- -->
    Vd = Ab / Cp

* Ab: total amount of drug
* Cp: plasma concentration of drug
<!-- -->
* Vd will be small if the drug is restricted to plasma
    * occurs due to binding with plasma proteins
    * occurs when drug is highly ionized at plasma pH
<!-- -->
* Vd will be large if the drug distributes into tissues
    * not found much in blood plasma, so the measured concentration will be very low

### **Drug Binding in Plasma**

* Free unbound drug fraction (D) is responsible for pharmacological action and elimination
* Bound drug fraction (DP) is not so available
    * represents a reservoir for the drug
<!-- -->
* Plasma protein binding is a site for drug-drug interactions
* Albumin is the most important drug-binding protein
* α-1 acid-glycoprotein is also important for binding certain basic drugs
    * α-1 acid-glycoprotein concentration increases during acute inflammation (acute phase protein)

A drug displaced from the plasma protein will distribute throughout Vd and its rate of elimination will increase, thus, its plasma concentration will not dramatically increase.

## **Clearance**
---

Volume of blood or plasma that is completely cleared of drug per unit time.

Clearance can be thought of as the intrinsic ability of the body or its organs of elimination (usually liver and kidneys) to remove drug from the blood.

    CL = rate of elimination / Cp

Example:

Assume that the rate of elimination of a drug is 10 mg/hour, and the plasma concentration is 1 mg/L. What is drug clearance?

    CL = rate of elimination / Cp

    CL = (10 mg/hour) / (1 mg/L)
    CL = 10 L/hour

For renal clearance:

    Renal clearance (CLR) = (Cu * V) / Cp

* Cu: concentration of drug in urine
* V: urine flow rate (volume per time)
* Cp: plasma concentration of the drug

## **Elimination**
---

### **First Order**

* Rate of drug elimination is directly proportional to amount of drug in the body
* Constant fraction of drug is eliminated per unit time
* No saturation of elimination process
* Elimination rate constant is "k" (fraction per time)


### **Zero Order**

* Saturable elimination
* Constant amount (not fraction) is eliminated per unit time
* Rate is independent of the amount of drug remaining
* Drug has prolonged half-life
* Elimination would be slow for high dose drugs
* Occurs for aspirin, phenytoin, ethanol

> *helpful video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Brpy8zybCAI*

|First Order Elimination|Zero Order Elimination|
|:-:|:-:|
|fixed **ratio** between drug conc. and elimination|fixed **amount** between drug conc. and elimination|
|not saturable|saturable|
|fixed t1/2|non-fixed t1/2|
|most drugs| aspirin, phenytoin, ethanol|

### **Half-Life**

It is the time required for the amount of drug in the body or the plasma concentration of the drug (assuming first-order elimination) to drop by 50%.

After ~4 half-lives, most of the drug will be eliminated from the body.

Related to first-order elimination rate constant such that:

    k * (t1/2) = 0.693

Half-life is related to volume of distribution and clearance for drugs that follow first-order kinetics by the following equation:

    CL = k * Vd
    t1/2 = 0.693 * Vd / CL

For zero order: the higher the dose, the longer the half-life

### **Steady State**

* Steady state is a condition achieved following repeated drug administration (as occurs in clinical practice)
* Occurs when the rate of administration (dosing rate) is equal to the rate of elimination
* Constant peak, trough, and average drug concentrations are achieved
* Achieved after approximately 4 half-lives of repeated adminstration
* 50% of SS is achieved after one half-life of administration

|:-:|

Aim is to attain a steady-state drug concentration (Css) within the therapeutic range but NOT subtherapeutic or toxic

If half-life is too long, SS will take a long time to be achieved. Thus we may give a loading dose to achieve drug concentration within the therapeutic range sooner.

Our desired steady-state concentration is called Css desired.

    Loading Dose = Vd * Css desired

To maintain Css desired, we adjust the dose so that the rate of administration is equal to the rate of elimination.

    Maintenance Dose = CL * Css desired

>*Css desired is also called the target concentration*
