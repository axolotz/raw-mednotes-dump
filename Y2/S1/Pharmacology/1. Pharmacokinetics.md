## **Overview**
---

Pharmodynamics is the effect of the drugs on the body (biochemical and physiological).


## **Receptors**
---

Most drugs exert their effect by interacting with specialized target macromolecules called receptors. Binding with receptor will cause conformational changes or a biochemical effect.

* Receptors determine specificity of drug
* Most are proteins
* Most drugs bind reversibly (non-covelant)
* Not all drugs use receptors

Two fundamental properties underly specificity in drug-receptor interactions:

* Complementarity of shape between drug and receptor (lock and key model)
* complementarity in electrostatic, hydrophobic, and hydrogen bonding surfaces of each component

|*lock and key model*|

Recognition sites are molecular regions of the receptor to which ligands bind to

Drug-receptor interactions are:

* Saturable
* Competitive
* Specific and selective

<!-- -->
The major receptor families are:
* **Ligand-gated ion channels**
    * responsible for regulation of the flow of ions channels across cell membranes
    * regulated binding of a ligand to the channels
    * e.g: nicotinic receptor, where binding acetylcholine results in sodium influx and the activation of contraction in skeletal muscle
<!-- -->
* **G protein-coupled receptors**
    * on the inner face of the plasma membrane
    * regulate effector proteins via group of GTP proteins known as G proteins
    * e.g: some hormone peptide receptors and neurotransmitter receptors
    * adrenergic and muscarinic receptors depend on the G proteins
<!-- -->
* **Enzyme-linked receptors**
    * ligand binding activates or inhibits the related cytosolic enzyme
    * most common are receptors with tyrosine kinase activity as part of their structure
        * binding results phosphorylation of tyrosine residues of specific protein
        * addition of phosphate group can modify the 3D structure of target protein
<!-- -->
* **Intercellular receptors**
    * ligand must diffuse into the cell
    * ligand must have sufficient lipid solubilities (to be able to move)
    * e.g: steroids hormones, where activated ligand-receptor complex migrates to nucleus

### **Antagonists**

An antagonist is a drug that binds to a receptor and prevents the agonist from binding (i.e: stops the action or effect of another substance).

* Some compounds bind to cell surface receptors without activating it
* The compound prevents the binding of endogenous agonist
* The compound is said to "antagonize" or "block" the receptor
    * known as "receptor antagonist"
<!-- -->
* If the binding is reversible: "competitive antagonists"
* If binding is irreversible: "noncompetitive antagonists"
<!-- -->
* Most antagonists bind to the binding site
* Some antagonists can also bind to a remote site on receptor
    * causes change in receptor that prevents endogenous agonist
    * causes "allosteric" effect
* Considered noncompetitive antagonist

Some examples:

* Antagonize cell surface receptors
    * Angiotensin Receptor Blockers (ARBs) for high BP, heart failure, chronic renal insufficiency
    * Beta Adrenoceptor Blockers for angina, myocardial infarction, heart failure, high BP, performance anxienty
<!-- -->
* Antagonize nuclear receptors
    * Mineralocorticoid Receptor Antagonists for edema due to liver cirrhosis and for heart failure
    * Estrogen Receptor Antagonists for prevention and treatment of breast cancer
<!-- -->
* Enzyme inhibitors
    * Cyclooxygenaase inhibitor for pain relief (e.g: aspirin, ibuprofen)
<!-- -->
* Ion channel blockers
    * Sodium channel blockers can help suppress cardiac arrythmias (e.g: licodaine)
<!-- -->
* Inhibit transporters
    * Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) (e.g: fluoxetine, aka Prozac)
    * Inhibitors of Na-2Cl-K Symporter to increase urine and sodium output for the treatment of edema
<!-- -->
* Inhibitors of Signal Transduction Proteins
    * Tyrosine kinase inhibitors for chronic myelocytic leukemia
    * Type 5 phosphodiesterase inhibitors for erectile dysfunction (e.g: sildenafil, aka viagra)

### **Agonists**

* Some chemicals bind to cell surface receptors and trigger a response
    * called "receptor agonists"
* Some agonists are actually the endogenous chemical signal, while others only mimic it
* They agonize receptors, open channels, and activate enzymes
* e.g: morphine agonists

### **Unconvential Mechanisms of Action**

* Disrupting structural proteins
    * e.g: colchicine for gout
<!-- -->
* Being enzymes
    * e.g: streptokinase for thrombolysis
<!-- -->
* Covelantly linking to macromolecules
<!-- -->
* Reacting chemically with small molecules
    * e.g: antacids for increased acidity
<!-- -->
* Binding free molecules or atoms
    * e.g: drugs for heavy metal poisoning, anti-TNF
<!-- -->
* Being nutrients
    * e.g: calcium supplements
<!-- -->
* Being antigens
    * e.g: vaccines
<!-- -->
* Exert actions due to physical properties
    * e.g: laxatives
<!-- -->
* Unkown mechanism
    * e.g: general anesthetics
