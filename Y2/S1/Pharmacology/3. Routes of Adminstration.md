## **Overview**
---

3 major routes:

* Enternal: via GI tract
* Paternal: non-intestinal means of administration
* Other


## **Enteral Routes**
---

### **Oral (PO)**
* Drug should be swallowed
* Most commonly used route
* Safest, most convenient, most economical
* Duodenum is the major site of absorption, but stomach, jejunum and ileum may be involved
<!-- -->
* Disadvantages:
    * patient must be cooperative (compliant)
    * absorption is variable due to several factors
        * vomiting
        * failure of disintegration and dissolution
        * first-pass effect
        * drug may be destroyed by gastric acid or intestinal flora
        * food may delay absorption
        * alteration in intestinal motility may affect absorption
        * absorption may be affected by splanchnic blood flow

### **Sublingual (SL)**
* Drug is placed under tongue
* Avoids first-pass effect
* Used when a rapid onset is required (such as in angina pectoris)
* Not commonly used

### **Rectal (PR)**
* Avoids first-pass effect partially (~ 50%)
* Useful in unconscious or vomiting patients
* Absorption is often irregular, incomplete, and unpredictable
* Can be used for a local effect
* Used for drugs poorly absorbed from, or unstable in the GIT
* Used for rapid effect
* Aseptic technique is required

## **Paternal Routes**
---

### **Intravenous (IV)**
* Bolus vs infusion
* Only aqueous solutions may be injected IV
* Rapid onset of action
* Oily vehicles or those that precipitate blood constituents should NOT be given IV
* No first-pass hepatic metabolism
    * drug goes first to right side of the heart, lung, left side of heart, then to systemic circulation
<!-- -->
* Disadvantages:
    * produce high initial concentration of the drug that might be toxic


### **Intramuscular (IM)**
* Drug is injected within muscle fibers of deltoid, gluteus maximus or vastus lateralis
* Absorption of drug depends on blood supply (slower for g.m).
* Absorption is reduced in circulatory failure or shock
* Drug must be non-irritating to tissues
<!-- -->
* Can utilize:
    * aqueous solutions for fast absorption and rapid action
    * depot preparations and suspensions for slow or sustained absorption (oily vehicles or ethylene glycol)
    * can accommodate large volumes

### **Subcutaneous Injections (SC, or SQ)**
* Drug is injected under the skin
* Absorption is affected by blood flow
* Drug should be non-irritating to tissues
* Absorption is slow and sustained
* Accommodate smaller volumes than IM
* Solid pellets can be implanted under the skin to produce effects over weeks-months

## **Other Routes**
---

### **Inhalational or Pulmonary**
* Used for gaseous or volatile drugs, such as general anesthetics
* Can also be used for solids that can be put in an aerosol
    * e.g: drugs for bronchial asthma
* Drugs are absorbed across pulmonary epithelium and mucous membranes of respiratory tract
* Absorption is rapid
* Avoids first-pass effect
* Lung also acts as a route of elimination

### **Topical Application**
* For local effect on:
    * mucous membranes: conjunctiva, nose, mouth, nasopharynx, oropharynx, vagina, rectum, colon, urethra, and urinary bladder
    * skin: highly lipid-soluble drugs can be absorbed systemically
* Systemic absorption also occurs from abraded, burned and inflamed skin

### **Transdermal route (TD)**
* The drug is applied to the skin for systemic effect, such as in angina
* For a sustained effect
* Avoids first-pass metabolism
