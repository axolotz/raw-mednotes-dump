## **Outcomes of Acute Inflammation**
---

An acute inflammation typicalls takes one of three major outcomes:


| Complete Resolution | Healing by Fibrosis | Chronic Inflammation |
|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| Injury is limited and there is minimal tissue destruction | Substantial tissue destruction, causing scar. May or may not impede function. | Progression into chronic. Occurs when acute cannot resolve the issue and injurious agent persists.|

Complete resolution is the desirable outcome.

## **Chronic Inflammation**
---

* Prolonged inflammation (weeks, months, maybe years)
* Inflammation, tissue injury, and repair attempts occur simultaneously
    * eventually causing scarring, impacting organ function
* Chronic usually follows acute, but not always the case.

### **Causes**

|Persistent infections| Mycobacteria (TB), viruses, fungi, parasites. Delayed hypersensitivity rxn. Granulomatous inflammation.|
|:--:|:--:|
|Hypersensitivity diseases|RA, asthma, autoimmune diseases, MS (may end in fibrosis of end organs).|
|Prolonged exposure to toxic agents (either exogenous or endogenous)| Silica (silicosis) (exogenous from outside environment). Atherosclerosis (endogenous due to cholesterol crystals).|
|Other associated diseases| Alzheimer's, Metabolicsyndrome of DM|

### **Morphology**

* Infiltration by chronic inflammatory cells
    * macrophages, lymphocytes, plasma cells
* Tissue destruction
* Healing attempts via angiogenesis and fibrosis
