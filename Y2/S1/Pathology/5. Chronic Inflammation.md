## **Outcomes of Acute Inflammation**
---

An acute inflammation typicalls takes one of three major outcomes:


| Complete Resolution | Healing by Fibrosis | Chronic Inflammation |
|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| limited injury, minimal tissue destruction | substantial tissue destruction, causing scar. May or may not impede function. | acute cannot resolve, injurious agent persists, inflammation progresses into chronic.|

Complete resolution is the desirable outcome.

## **Chronic Inflammation Overview**
---

* Prolonged inflammation (weeks, months, maybe years)
* Inflammation, tissue injury, and repair attempts occur simultaneously
    * eventually causing scarring, impacting organ function
* Chronic usually follows acute, but not always the case.

### **Causes**

|Persistent infections| mycobacteria (TB), viruses, fungi, parasites, etc.|
|:--:|:--:|
|Hypersensitivity diseases| asthma, autoimmune diseases, etc.|
|Prolonged exposure to toxic agents (either exogenous or endogenous)| silica (silicosis) (exogenous from outside environment). atherosclerosis (endogenous due to cholesterol crystals).|
|Other associated diseases| alzheimer's, metabolicsyndrome of DM|

### **Morphology**

* Infiltration by macrophages, lymphocytes, and plasma cells
* Tissue destruction
* Healing attempts via angiogenesis and fibrosis

## **Cells and Mediators**
---

* Macrophages
* Lymphocytes
* Eosinophils
* Mast cells + Basophils

### **Macrophages**

The dominant cells in most chronic inflammatory rxns are macrophages. They contribute to the rxn by secreting cytokines and growth factors that act on various cells, by destroying foreign invaders and tissues, and also activating other cells (notably T lymphocytes).

Macrophages begin in the bone marrow as hemopoietic stem cells, then differentiate and enter blood circulation as monocytes. When monocytes leave the vessels and move into tissue, they mature into macrophages.

* Secrete cytokines (TNF, IL-1, chemokines, etc.)
* Feedback loop with T-cells (increase or decrease infl. response)
* Phagocytosis
* 1 day half-life when they are circulating monocytes
    * extended when they enter tissue

* Tissue macrophage examples:
    * kuppfer cells (liver)
    * sinus histiocytes
    * alveolar macrophages
    * microglia

|*monocyte*|*macrophage*|

Macrophages can be activated by 2 pathways: M1 classic pathway or M2 alternative pathway

* **M1 Classical Pathway**
    * pro-inflammatory
    * active in microbicidial actions and phagocytosis (killing bacteria, fungi, etc.)
    * there are major drivers that push the monocyte into M1 pathway, they are:
        * microbial TLR ligands
        * interferon-γ (IFN-γ)

> *remember from acute inflammation that interferon-γ also stimulates iNOS*

* **M2 Alternative Pathway**
    * major drivers are IL-13 and IL-4
    * that leads to secretion of IL-10 and TGF-β
    * secretions have anti-inflammatory effects and stimulate repair

To sum up: M1 pathway leads to pro-inflammatory effects, while the M2 pathway is anti-inflammatory.

### **Lymphocytes**

Include T and B lymphocytes.

* Main cells seen in chronic inflammation
* T and B lymphocytes activated by microbes and enviromental antigens
* CD4+ (aka T-helper cells) are a T-cell subvariant
    * secrete cytokines inducing inflammation
    * TH1, TH2, and TH17

|T-helper|Function|
|:--:|:--:|
|TH1|INF-γ, activate macrophages in M1 pathway|
|TH2|IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, activate eosinophils and push macrophages into M2 pathway|
|TH17|induce chemokine secretion and recruit neutrophils|

### **Eosinophils**

Hallmark features: binucleated with pink granulated cytoplasm.

* Found in inflammatory sites around parasitic infections
* Part of immune rxns mediated by IgE
* Granules contain basic proteins that are toxic to parasites
* May cause tissue damage
<!-- -->
* Chronic eosonophilic inflammation is characterized by huge quantities of eosonophils

### **Mast Cells**

Cells widely distributed in connective tissues throughout the body, and they can participate in both acute and chronic inflammatory responses.

* heavily granulated cells
* abundant in soft tissues
* produce cytokines in chronic inflammations
* Mast cells and basophils express FceR1 receptor
    * FceR1 binds to FC part of IgE
    * leads to degranulation and histamine release
    * this occurs when exposed to food allergy, venom, etc.

### **Neutrophils**

Can remain after acute inflammation (in case of persistent injury).

* can be seen in chronic osteomyelitis (inflammation in bones)
* can be seen in acute on chronic inflammations (acute on top of chronic)
* lung damage from smoking is mediated by neutrophils

## **Granulomatous Inflammation**
---

Type of chronic inflammation characterized by presence of granulomas.

Granuloma are a collection of aggregated macrophages that forms in response to chronic inflammation.

Granulomatous inflammation usually contain granulomas of epithelioid histiocytes (type of activated macrophage), lymphocytes, and plasma cells.

* Two types of granulomas
    * non-necrotizing (no central necrosis)
    * necrotizing (central necrosis)
        * looks like white cheese material (sometimes called caseating)

There are also immune granulomas (seen in certain autoimmune diseases) and foreign body granuloma (response to foreign body).

If you see central necrosis, then it is a necrotizing granuloma. Central necrosis usually contains a pinkish center with no bluish neucleus material. However, non-necrotizing contains nuclei.

> *notice the distinct differences of granuloma centers between necrotizing and non-necrotizing*

* necrotizing granulomas are usually caused by mycobacterium tubercolosis (TB)
* more tests are done to check for TB and fungus

## **Systemic Effects**
---

Inflammations are usually associated with systemic effects collectively called the "acute-phase response".

Cytokines TNF, IL-1, and IL-6 are the most important mediators of the acute-phase rxn.
