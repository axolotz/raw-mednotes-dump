## **Overview**
---

To avoid tissue injury, the inflammatory response needs to be controlled and regulated.

There are mechanisms in place to control, regulate, and eventually terminate the inflammatory response:

* mediators are produced in rapid bursts (not continous)
* release is stimulus dependent
* short half-lives
* degrade after release
* neutrophil/PMN short life
* production of stop signals at the end of IR
* neural inhibitors


There are major general features of mediators of inflammation:

* cell derived at site of injury
* plasma proteins need activation, active mediators need stimulation
* most mediators have short lifespan
* one can activate the other

> *Somewhere along this point the prof. puts up a table of mediators that we are supposed to know. Leave it for now, study it at the end of mediators, it will be easier after you go through the lesson.*

## **Arachidonic Acid Metabolites**
---

The lipid mediators prostaglandins and leukotrienes are produced from arachidonic acid, they stimulate vascular and cellular rxns in acute inflammation.

Mediators derived from arachidonic acid are called eicosanoids (prof. hates that name).

* Arachidonic acid is present in membrane phospholipids.
* A stimulus or mediator (e.g: C5a) can trigger the release of that arachidonic acid by activating phospholipase.
* Phospholipase damages the membrane, releasing the arachidonic acid.
<!-- -->
* Once out of the membrane, enzymes rapidly convert arachidonic acid into bioactive mediators.
* These enzymes are either cyclooxygenases or lipoxygenases.
    * cyclooxygenases generate prostaglandins
    * lipoxygenases produce leukotrienes and lipoxins

To sum up: arachidonic acid exists inside the phospholipid membrane. A stimulus acivates phospholipase, damaging the membrane, which releases the acid. Enzymes then convert the acid into mediators. This can go two ways, either the enzyme is a cyclooxygenase or a lipoxygenase. Depending on the enzyme you get different mediators.

### **COX Products**

See image above for reference.

* PGI2 causes vasodilation while TXA2 causes vasoconstriction
* PGI2 inhibits platelet aggregation, while TXA2 promotes platelet aggregation
<!-- -->
* An imbalance between PGI2 and TXA2 can possibly cause ischemic heart disease atherosclerosis or cerebrovascular accident (stroke)

>*professor mentioned that PGI2 and TXA2 will come on the exam*

PGD2 and PGE2 have a less critical function, they serve to vasodilate and increase vasscular permeability.

### **LOX Products**

Lipooxygenase products include leukotrienes (LT) and lipoxins

* LTB4's main function is as a chemoattractant for chemotaxis
* LTC4, D4, E4 play a role in bronchospasms and increase in vasc. permeability
    * thus they are targeted for therapy to control asthma attacks

Lipoxin A4 and Lipoxin B4 make general inhibition of inflammation,
particularly anti-chemotaxis.


| Action | Eicosanoid/AA Metabolite |
|:--:|:--:|
|Vasodilation| PGI2, PGE1, PGE2, PGD2|
|Vasoconstriction| TXA2, leukotrienes C4, D4, E4|
|Increased vascular permeability|leukotrienes C4, D4, E4|
|Chemotaxis, leukocyte adhesion|LTB4|
|Smooth muscle contraction| Prostaglandins C4, D4, E4|


### **Pharmacologic Inhibitors**

As seen in the image above, some drugs target this process.

* Steroids
    * very strong and potent anti-inflamamtory drugs
    * inhibit phospholipase
    * thus entirely inhibit both pathways
<!-- -->
* COX-1 and COX-2 inhibitors, aspirin, indomethacin
    * called "anti-prostaglandins"
    * inhibit cyclooxygenases
    * thus only inhibit prostaglandin production

<!-- -->
* Lipooxygenase inhibitors
    * inhibit lipooxygenase
    * thus only inhibit leukotriene and lipoxin production

Steroids are the strongest, the other two types are not as strong.

**Summary (AA metabolites)**
* Aspirin inhibits cyclooxygenase (COX)
* Steroids inhibit phospholipase and are anti-inflammatory
* Prostacyclin (PGI2) vasodilator and inhibits platelet aggregation.
* TXA2 vasoconstrictor and promotes platelet aggregation.
* TXA2 and PGI2 imbalance can lead to ischemic heart disease (IHD) and CV (stroke).
* PGE2 is a major mediator for pain and fever.

Cyto-kines. Kine meaning kinetic function, cyto meaning produced by cells.
