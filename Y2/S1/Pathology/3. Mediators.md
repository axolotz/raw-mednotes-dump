## **Overview**
---

To avoid tissue injury, the inflammatory response needs to be controlled and regulated.

There are mechanisms in place to control, regulate, and eventually terminate the inflammatory response:

* mediators are produced in rapid bursts (not continous)
* release is stimulus dependent
* short half-lives
* degrade after release
* neutrophil/PMN short life
* production of stop signals at the end of IR
* there are neural inhibitors

There are major general features of mediators of inflammation:

* derived at site of injury
* plasma proteins need activation, active mediators need stimulation
* most mediators have short lifespan
* one can activate the other

> *Somewhere along this point the prof. puts up a table of mediators that we are supposed to know. Leave it for now, study it at the end of mediators, it will be easier after you go through the lesson. You will be a lot more familiar with them, and they will be easier to remember.*

> *we we are now mostly at R3, "regulation".*

## **Arachidonic Acid Metabolites**
---

The lipid mediators prostaglandins and leukotrienes are produced from arachidonic acid, they stimulate vascular and cellular rxns in acute inflammation.

Mediators derived from arachidonic acid are called eicosanoids (prof. hates that name).

* Arachidonic acid is present in membrane phospholipids.
* A stimulus or mediator (e.g: C5a) can trigger the release of that arachidonic acid by activating phospholipase.
* Phospholipase damages the membrane, releasing the arachidonic acid.
<!-- -->
* Once out of the membrane, enzymes rapidly convert arachidonic acid into bioactive mediators.
* These enzymes are either cyclooxygenases or lipoxygenases.
    * cyclooxygenases generate prostaglandins
    * lipoxygenases produce leukotrienes and lipoxins

To sum up: arachidonic acid exists inside the phospholipid membrane. A stimulus acivates phospholipase, damaging the membrane, which releases the acid. Enzymes then convert the acid into mediators. This can go two ways, either the enzyme is a cyclooxygenase or a lipoxygenase. Depending on the enzyme you get different mediators.

### **COX Products**

See image above for reference.

* PGI2 causes vasodilation while TXA2 causes vasoconstriction
* PGI2 inhibits platelet aggregation, while TXA2 promotes platelet aggregation
<!-- -->
* An imbalance between PGI2 and TXA2 can possibly cause ischemic heart disease atherosclerosis or cerebrovascular accident (stroke)

>*professor mentioned that PGI2 and TXA2 will come on the exam*

PGD2 and PGE2 have a less critical function, they serve to vasodilate and increase vascular permeability.

### **LOX Products**

Lipooxygenase products include leukotrienes (LT) and lipoxins

* LTB4's main function is as a chemoattractant for chemotaxis
* LTC4, D4, E4 play a role in bronchospasms and increase in vasc. permeability
    * thus they are targeted for therapy to control asthma attacks

Lipoxin A4 and Lipoxin B4 make general inhibition of inflammation,
particularly anti-chemotaxis.


| Action | Eicosanoid/AA Metabolite |
|:--:|:--:|
|Vasodilation| PGI2, PGE1, PGE2, PGD2|
|Vasoconstriction| TXA2, leukotrienes C4, D4, E4|
|Increased vascular permeability|leukotrienes C4, D4, E4|
|Chemotaxis, leukocyte adhesion|LTB4|
|Smooth muscle contraction| Prostaglandins C4, D4, E4|


### **Pharmacologic Inhibitors**

As seen in the image above, some drugs target this process.

* Steroids
    * very strong and potent anti-inflamamtory drugs
    * inhibit phospholipase
    * thus entirely inhibit both pathways
<!-- -->
* COX-1 and COX-2 inhibitors, aspirin, indomethacin
    * called "anti-prostaglandins"
    * inhibit cyclooxygenases
    * thus only inhibit prostaglandin production

<!-- -->
* Lipooxygenase inhibitors
    * inhibit lipooxygenase
    * thus only inhibit leukotriene and lipoxin production

Steroids are the strongest, the other two types are not as strong.

**Summary (AA metabolites)**
* Aspirin inhibits cyclooxygenase (COX)
* Steroids inhibit phospholipase and are anti-inflammatory
* Prostacyclin (PGI2) vasodilator and inhibits platelet aggregation.
* TXA2 vasoconstrictor and promotes platelet aggregation.
* TXA2 and PGI2 imbalance can lead to ischemic heart disease (IHD) and CV (stroke).
* PGE2 is a major mediator for pain and fever.

## **Cytokines**
---

Cytokines are secreted by many cells predominantly activated lymphocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells.

They mediate and regulate immune and inflamamtory response.

|Cytokine|Principal Sources|Principal Actions in Inflammation|
|:--:|:--:|:--:|
|**In Acute Inflammation**|
|TNF|
|IL-1|
|IL-6|
|Chemokines|
|IL-17|T lymphocytes|recruitment of nuetrophils and monocytes|
|**In Chronic Inflammation**|
|IL-12|
|IL-Î³|T-lymphocytes, NK cells|
|IL-17|T lymphocytes|recruitment of nuetrophils and monocytes|


### **Major Effects**

Cytokines can serve multiple major effects. These include:

* Local inflammation
* Systemic protective effects
* Systemic pathologic effects

>*systemic means affecting the entire body, rather than a single organ or body part*

|*major roles of cytokines in acute inflammation*|

* Local inflammation are the local effects we mentioned before
<!-- -->
* Systemic protective effects
    * induce fever
    * acute-phase proteins in the liver
    * stimulate more hematopoietic cells in bone marrow
<!-- -->
* Systemic pathologic effects
    * can affect heart causing low output or heart failure
    * TNF may cause platelet aggregation and thrombus formation
        * may cause ischemia in the heart or other organs
    * TNF may also cause insulin resistance

### **Chemokines**

Family of cytokines. Small proteins, mainly chemoattractants.

* Act via G-protein coupled receptors
* Serve 2 main functions
    * inflammation
    * maintaining tissue architecture

## **Complement System**
---

The complement system is a collection of soluble proteins and their membrane receptors that function mainly in host defense against microbes and in pathologic inflammatory rxns.

Complement system activation is also known as "complement fixation".

* Inactive proteins that need activation
* More than 20
    * C1-C9 are the most common
    * C3 specifically is the most common
        * cleavage of C3 activates the complement system
<!-- -->
* Important in innate and adaptive immunity
* Functions
    * vascular permeability
    * chemotaxis
    * opsonitzation

### **Activation Pathways**
There are 3 pathways for C3 activation (which activates the complement system cascade):
* Alternative pathway
* Classical pathway
* Lectin pathway

|![](https://emedicodiary.com/files/87c827ef0b9d079f92f2ed7cd3d4875a.jpg)|
|:--:|

* Alternative pathway
    * triggered by bacterial polysaccharides
<!-- -->
* Classical pathway
    * triggered by antigen-antibody complex
    * invader produces antibodies, antibody joins antigens, the antigen-antibody triggers activation
<!-- -->
* Lectin pathway
    * triggered by mannose receptor binding to lectin


After that, activated C3 goes into 3 pathways (image above):

* C5a, C3a Inflammation
    * C3a (active part) functions as a chemotactic agent to recruit/activate leukocytes.
    * This induces the production of C5a and C3a
<!-- -->
* C3b Phagocytosis
    * C3b is important in stimulating phagocytosis.
    * assists macrophages and neutrophils in phagocytosis.
<!-- -->
* MAC lysis of microbe
    * continous stimulation of cascade leads to activation of C5, C6, C7.
    * C5, C6, C7 then produce "membrane attack complex"
    * MAC is made up of multiples of C9.
    * MAC directly kills without the need for phagocytosis
        * create pores in microbial wall that disrupt osmotic balance, killing the microbe.


### **Functions**

* Inflammation
    * anphylatoxins such as C5a
<!-- -->
* Opsonization & phagocytosis
    * C3b is the strongest opsonizing agent
<!-- -->
* Cell lysis
    * MAC

### **Regulation**

* C1 inhibitor
    * normally present to inhibit C1
    * if deficient ---> angioedema
<!-- -->
* Decay accelerating factor (DAF)
    * inhibits C3 convertase
        * this inhibits MAC
        * abnormalities can cause PNH (paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria)
<!-- -->
* Factor H
    * proteolysis of C3 convertase
    * mutation of Factor H can cause hemolytic uremic syndrome

CS protein deficiencies can occur (rare) lead to infection susceptability (e.g: C3 deficiency is critical)

## **Other Mediators**
---

* Platelet activating factor (PAF)
    * platelet aggregation and other functions
<!-- -->
* Protease activating receptors (PAR)
    * platelet aggregation
<!-- -->
* Kinins
    * group of vasoactive peptides
    * bradykinin is the most active
    * vasodilation
    * increased vasc. permeability
    * smooth muscle contraction and pain
<!-- -->
* Neuropeptides
    * Substance P and neurokinin A
