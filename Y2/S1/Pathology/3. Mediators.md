## **Overview**

To avoid tissue injury, the inflammatory response needs to be controlled and regulated.

There are mechanisms in place to control, regulate, and eventually terminate the inflammatory response:

* mediators are produced in rapid bursts (not continous)
* release is stimulus dependent
* short half-lives
* degrade after release
* neutrophil/PMN short life
* production of stop signals at the end of IR
* neural inhibitors

Major acute inflammation mediator groups include:

* Vasoactive amine
* Lipid products
* Cytokines
* Complement system

There are major general features of mediators of inflammation:

* cell derived at site of injury
* plasma proteins need activation, active mediators need stimulation
* most mediators have short lifespan
* one can activate the other


Principal mediators of inflammation:

| Mediator | Source | Action |
|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| Histamine | mast cells, basophils, platelets | vasodilation, increased vasc. permeability, endothelial activation |
|Prostaglandins| mast cells, leukocytes | vasodilation, pain, fever|
|Leukotrienes| mast cells, leukocytes| increased vasc. permeability, chemotaxis, leukocyte adhesion, activation|
|Cytokines (TNF, IL-1, IL-6)|macrophages, endothelial cells, mast cells|local: endothelial activation (expression of adhesion molecules). systemic: fever, metabolic abnormalities, hypotension (shock)|
|Chemokines|leukocytes, activated macrophages|chemotaxis, leukocyte activation|
Platelet-activating factor| leukocytes, mast cells| vasodilation, increased vasc. permeability, leukocyte adhesion, chemotaxis, degranulation, oxidative burst|

> *notice how you can divide them into cell-derived and plasma-derived*

> *prof. said you have to know this table, they are important as most of the mediators are targets for therapy*
