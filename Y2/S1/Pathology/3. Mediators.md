## **Overview**
---

To avoid tissue injury, the inflammatory response needs to be controlled and regulated.

There are mechanisms in place to control, regulate, and eventually terminate the inflammatory response:

* mediators are produced in rapid bursts (not continous)
* release is stimulus dependent
* short half-lives
* degrade after release
* neutrophil/PMN short life
* production of stop signals at the end of IR
* neural inhibitors


There are major general features of mediators of inflammation:

* cell derived at site of injury
* plasma proteins need activation, active mediators need stimulation
* most mediators have short lifespan
* one can activate the other


## **Arachidonic Acid Metabolites**
---

The lipid mediators prostaglandins and leukotrienes are produced from arachidonic acid, they stimulate vascular and cellular rxns in acute inflammation.

* Arachidonic acid is present in membrane phospholipids.
* A stimulus or mediator (e.g: C5a) can trigger the release of that arachidonic acid by activating phospholipase.
* Once freed from the membrane, enzymes rapidly convert arachidonic acid to bioactive mediators.
<!-- -->
* The enzymes are either cyclooxygenases (COX) or lipoxygenases
    * cyclooxygenases generate prostaglandins
    * lipoxygenases produce leukotrienes and lipoxins

To sum up: arachidonic acid exists inside the phospholipid membrane. A stimulus acivates phospholipase, damaging the membrane, which releases the acid. Enzymes then convert the acid into mediators. The enzymes are either cyclooxygenases or lipoxygenases.

### **Pharmacologic Inhibitors**

As seen in the image above, some drugs target this process.

* Steroids
    * very strong and potent anti-inflamamtory drugs
    * inhibit phospholipase
    * thus entirely inhibit both pathways
<!-- -->
* COX-1 and COX-2 inhibitors, aspirin, indomethacin
    * called "anti-prostaglandins"
    * inhibit cyclooxygenases
    * thus only inhibit prostaglandin production

<!-- -->
* Lipooxygenase inhibitors
    * inhibit lipooxygenase
    * thus only inhibit leukotriene and lipoxin production

Steroids are the strongest, the other two types are not as strong.
