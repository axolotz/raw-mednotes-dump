## **Overview**
---

Tissue repair is part of the inflammatory response's (5th "R").

Inflammation may cause injury, repair is critical after eliminating injurious agent.

Repair can be achieved by two types of rxns:

* Regeneration (1st intention repair)
    * occurs in mild and superficial injuries.
    * replaces damaged components and essentially returns to pre-injury state.
<!-- -->
* Scar and Fibrosis (2nd intention repair)
    * occurs in severe injury
    * repair occurs by laying down connective (fibrous) tissue

Both require mediators, cellular proliferation, and interactions within the ECM.

## **Regeneration**
---

Tissue regeneration depends on the type of tissue.

There are 3 main tissue types:

|Tissue Type|Regeneration|Examples|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|Labile Tissue|continously regenerate|epithelia of mucosal surfaces, some bone marrow elements|
|Stable Tissue|exist in a non-dividing state (G0), but can be stimulated to regenerate|liver, kidney, pancreasenormally|
|Permenant Tissue|terminally differentiated, non-proliferative, cannot regenerate|neurons, cardiac muscle|

### **Liver Regeneration**

The liver can regenerate in two ways:

* Hepatocyte proliferation
    * i.e: post hepatectomy (liver grows back)
<!-- -->
* Regeneration from progenitor cells
    * progenitor cells are activated, then proliferate, and differentiate
    * occurs if proliferative capacity of hepatocytes is impaired

Both need growth factors, cytokines, and cell matrix interactions.


## **Scarring**
---

If repair cannot be accomplished by regeneration alone, it occurs by replacement of the injured cells with connective tissue, leading to the formation of a scar, or by a combination of regeneration and scar formation.

Steps:

* Hemostatic plug (platelets)...minutes
* Inflammation (macs, M1, M2)...6-48 hours
* Cell proliferation (granulation tissue)...10 days
* Remodeling....2-3 weeks

### **Angiogenesis**

Angiogenesis is the process of new blood vessel development from existing vessels.

Angiogenesis involves several signaling pathways, cell–cell interactions, ECM proteins, and tissue enzymes.

* Growth factors
    * VEGF-A (vascular endothelial growth factor)
    * FGFs (fibroblast growth factor)
        * mainly FGF-2
    * TGF-β (transforming growth factor)
        * TGF-β is possibly the most potent
<!-- -->
* Notch Signalling
    * regulates the sprouting and branching of new vessels
    * ensures that new vessels have proper spacing to effectively supply healing tissue
<!-- -->
* Enzymes
    * enzymes in ECM degrade the ECM
        * most notably matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs)
    * so that remodeling and extension of the vascular tube can occur

### **Activation of Fibroblasts & Deposition of Matrix**

Fibroblasts and myoblasts help lay down collagen to close the gap. The laying down of connective tissue occurs in two steps:

* migration and proliferation of fibroblasts into site of injury
* deposition of ECM proteins produced


This process needs cytokines and GFs:
* PDGF
* FGF-2
* TGF-β

TGF-β is the most important cytokine for synthesis and deposition of connective tissue proteins.

The major sources of these factors are inflammatory cells, particularly alternatively activated (M2) macrophages that infiltrate sites of injury.

> *remember that M2 macrophages stimulate repair*

### **Remodeling**

After the scar is formed, it is remodeled to increase its strength and contract it.

This is done by:

* Cross-linking collagen
* Switching type III to type I

With time, the connective tissue is degraded and the scar shrinks.

* Collagen degradation is done by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs).
    * MMPs are balanced by their inhibitors (TIMPs)

## **Impairment**
---

9 major factors that impair the repair process:

* **Infections**
    * causes delayed healing
    * prolongs inflammation and potentially increases local tissue injury
<!-- -->
* **Diabetes**
    * compromises tissue repair for many reasons
    * specifically impacts Angiogenesis
<!-- -->
* **Nutritional Status**
    * malnutrition affects collagen synthesis and retards healing
<!-- -->
* **Steroids**
    * result in weak scars
    * have anti-inflammatory effects
    * patients on steroids are also likely immuno-compromised
<!-- -->
* **Mechanical Factors**
    * e.g: increased local pressure or torsion may cause wounds to pull apart (dehisce).
<!-- -->
* **Poor Perfusion**
    * perfusion is the passage of fluid through the circulatory or lymphatic system to an organ or tissue
    * poor perfusion can result from arteriosclerosis, diabetes, or obstructed venous drainage
        * e.g: varicose veins (obstructed venous drainage)
    * impairs healing
<!-- -->
* **Foreign Bodies**
    * as fragments of steel, glass, or even bone impede healing
<!-- -->
* **Type and extent of tissue injury**
    * injury to tissues composed of nondividing cells will result in scarring
        * e.g: healing of a myocardial infarct
    * complete restoration can occur only with cells capable of proliferating
<!-- -->
* **Site of Injury**
    * e.g: facial wounds heal faster than abdominal wounds

> *prof. mentioned that some complicated patients can have many of these factors together*

## **Abnormal Healing & Scarring**
---

Abnormal healing can include:

* Deficient scar formation
* Excessive repair
* Contractures

> *prof. said that it is not a matter of "if" but a matter of "when" you will come across a patient with a problem in wound healing*


### **Deficient Healing**

* Venous leg ulcers
    * caused by problems with circulation in leg veins
    * develops most often in elderly people as a result of chronic venous hypertension
    * usually bluish or grey
    * usually superficial (not deep compared to arterial ulcers)
<!-- -->
* Arterious ulcers
    * develop in individuals with atherosclerosis of peripheral arteries
    * especially associated with diabetes
    * deeper compared to venous ulcers
<!-- -->
* Diabetic ulcers
    * affects lower extremities, particularly feet
<!-- -->
* Pressure sores
    * skin ulceration and necrosis caused by prolonged compression of tissues
    * occurs in bedridden patients

### **Excessive Healing**

* Hypertrophic scar
    * accumulation of excessive amounts of collagen may result in a raised scar known as a hypertrophic scar
<!-- -->
* Keloid scar
    * grows beyond the boundaries of original wound and does not regress
    * occurs more in people of African descent
<!-- -->
* Exuberent granulation (proud flesh)
    * formation of excessive amounts of granulation tissue
<!-- -->
* Agressive fibromatosis
<!-- -->
* Contractures
    * exaggerated wound contraction
    * can compromise the movement of joints
    * commonly seen after serious burns

### **Organ Fibrosis**

Most abnormal healing we mentioned earlier was cutaneous.

Fibrosis is the excessive deposition of collagen and other ECM components in a tissue.

* Organ fibrosis is usually due to continous infectious or immunologic injuries
* May result in substantial organ dysfunction or even organ failure
* TGF-β is the most common cytokine of fibrosis
* e.g: liver cirrhosis, idiopathic lung fibrosis, ESKD
    * alcohol is a common cause of liver cirhhosis
