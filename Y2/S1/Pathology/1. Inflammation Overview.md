## **Inflammation Overview**

---

* <mark> Vascularized tissue response to injury</mark> (e.g: infection or tissue damage)
* Cells/molecules are recruited from circulation and moved to site to eliminate offending agent.
* <mark>Inflammation is protective in nature.</mark>

### **Cardinal Signs**

Infl. has 5 major cardinal signs (cardinal sign = major signs/symptoms)

* Redness
* Swelling
* Heat
* Pain
* Loss of function
    * e.g: cannot use toe with grout

>*can be remembered with the song: Red, Swelling, Heat and Pain (heat and pain)!*
\
*sung to the tune of "Head, Shoulders, Knees, and Toes")*

### **Damage**

Inflammation is a <mark>benificial host response</mark> to foreign invaders and necrotic tissue. However, <mark>it may also cause damage</mark>.

* Too much can cause tissue damage.
* Too little can also cause damage (increased susceptibility to infections)
* Misdirected or chronic infl. can cause damage.
    * autoimmune diseases are misdirected immune responses (e.g: immune response attacks kidney, not the strep throat)
    * Chronic infl. can cause chronic disease


### **Causes**

### **Acute vs Chronic**

Inflammations are <mark>generally divided into acute and chronic:</mark>

* **Acute:**
    * immediate and early response
    * quick, prominent, and mild
<!-- -->
* **Chronic:**
    * infl. of prolonged duration (weeks/months/years)
    * slow, severe, and less prominent

Acute inflammation either eliminates injurious agent, causing a decline of infl. and repair of damaged tissue, or it might result in chronic infl. if the injury persists.

Sometimes both acute and chronic can occur simultaneously. (e.g: basline chronic infl. + acute on top)

| Feature | Acute | Chronic |
|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| Onset | fast: mins or hrs | slow: days|
| Cellular infiltrate | mainly neutrophils | monocytes/macrophages and lymphocytes |
| Tissue injury, fibrosis | usually mild/self-limited | may be severe and progressive |
| Local and systemic signs | prominent | less prominent|

>*professor said to know this table very well*
\
*also important to know that acute infl. is hallmarked by the presence of neutrophils*


## **Inflammation Steps (5 Rs)**

---

The steps of inflammation can summed up in the "5 Rs". They are, in order:

* **Recognize:** offending agent is recognized by cells/tissues
* **Recruit:** WBCs (leukocytes) and plasma proteins are recruited to the site of injury
* **Remove:** WBCs/Plasma Proteins work to remove injurious agent
* **Regulate:** response is regulated/controlled after removal of injurious agent
* **Repair:** repair of damaged tissue

>*Try to put most of what you study within the context of the "5 Rs".*

### **Recognition**

* Toll-Like Receptors (TLRs) recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs).
    * TLRs are cellular receptors normally present in membreanes and endosomes.
* Other sensors detect damage-associated molecul patterns (DAMPs)
* All these consequently activate inflammasomes (cytoplasmic proteins) and other proteins

**Summary**

General features and causes of inflammation:
* benificial host response to foreign invaders and necrotic tissue, but may also cause damage.
* inflammations steps can be remembered by the "5 Rs": (1) **recognition** of injurious agent, (2) **recruitment** of leukocytes, (3) **removal** of agent, (4) **regulation** of response, (5) **repair**.
* inflammation causes include infections, tissue necrosis, foreign bodies, trauma, and immune responses.
* epithelial cells, dendritic cells, macrophages, leukocytes, and other types of cells express receptors that sense the presence of microbes and necrotic cells.
* outcome of inflammation is either elimination of stimulus (followed by decline of rxn and repair of damaged tissue), or the injury persists resulting in chronic inflammation.
