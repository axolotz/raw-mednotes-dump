## **Acute Inflammation Overview**
---
Acute inflammation lasts minutes to days.
It is <mark>characterized by exudation</mark> of fluid and plasma protein and <mark>emigration of leukocytes</mark> (predominantly neotrophils).

Acute inflammations have 2 major components:

* **Vascular changes** (vasodilation, increased vascular permeability, etc.)
* **Cellular changes** (leukocyte migration then elimination of injurious agent)

Previously we have talked about R1 (recognition). These notes talk about R2 (recruitment) and R3 (removal). Vascular and cellular changes discussed here are within R2 and R3.

> *to better organize your thoughts, look at the content list on the top right of the page.*

## **Vascular Responses**
---

Vascular changes include:
* vasodilation
* increased vascular permeability
* Lymph vessels may also participate

### **Vasodilation**
* <mark>Histamine is the major mediator of vasodilation</mark>
* vasodilation leads to increased blood flow
    * increased blood flow causes erythema (redness) and heat


### **Increased Vascular Permeability**

Normally, there is zero net flow in/out of vessels. Vascular leakage usually indicates a problem.

During vascular leakage,  either fluid alone is leaking out, or fluid+proteins.

* When vessels are "tight", only fluid will leak out, but larger proteins will not be able to (transudate)
* When endothelial cells "loosen up" and create gaps, proteins will leak out with the fluid (exudate)


<mark>Therefore, vascular leakage is either transudate or exudate.</mark> Exudate is a leakage of proteins+fluid from the vessels out into tissues. Transudate is mostly fluid only.


| Transudate      | Exudate |
| :-: | :-: |
| low protein      | high protein       |
| low cell content   | many cells and debris        |
| low specific gravity   | high specific gravity        |
| caused by osmotic/hydrostatic pressure imbalance   | caused by increased vascular permeability and denotes inflammatory rxn        |

|:--:|


* During infl., <mark>histamine and other mediators cause retraction of endothelial cells.</mark>
    * this creates little gaps causing protein leakage (i.e: exudate) (see image above)
    * thus, <mark>inflammation is usually associated with exudate</mark>


<mark>Edema can be either transudate or exudate</mark>
\
Pus is only exudative (pus is purulent, meaning very rich in proteins, leukocytes, etc.)
* exudate generally indicates inflammation, cancer, or other severe condition.
* it is thick, creamy (due to protein content), and may be bloody
* exudate is usually colored, while transudate is transparent.

### **Lymph Nodes**

Lymphatic vessels also participate in acute inflammation.

Normally, lymphatics drain extravascular fluid. During inflammation however, lymph flow is increased to help drain edema fluid that accumulates from the increased vascular permeability.

Lymph channels drain into lymph nodes. Therefore, lymph channel inflammation may cause enlargement of the nodes.

* <mark>**Lymphangitis:**</mark> inflammation of lymphatic channels.
* <mark>**Lymphandenitis:**</mark> lymph node enlargement.

> *prof mentioned that these are common issues you will see in clinical years*


{{< hint info >}}
**Summary (vascular responses)**
* Vasodilation is induced by inflammatory mediators such as histamine, and is the cause of erythema and stasis of blood flow.
* Increased vascular permeability is induced by histamine, kinins, and other mediators that produce gaps between endothelial cells, by direct or leukocyte-induced endothelial injury, and by increased passage of fluids through the endothelium.
* Increased vascular permeability allows plasma proteins and leukocytes, the mediators of host defense, to enter sites of infection or tissue damage. Fluid leak from blood vessels (exudation) results in edema.
* Lymphatic vessels and lymph nodes also are involved in inflammation, and often show redness and swelling.
{{< /hint >}}


## **Cellular Responses**
---

Almost all leukocytes play a role in inflammation. However, macrophages and neutrophils play the main role in acute inflammations.

Neutrophils and macrophages function to:
* Eliminate microbes via phagocytosis
* Secrete mediators to recruit more inflammatory cells at injury site

This is done in 3 main steps:
* **Emigration** (leukocytes going out of blood vessels and into tissue)
* **Chemotaxis** (leukocyte movement towards the injury site)
* **Leukocyte Activation** (elimination of the injurious agent)



### **Emigration**

<mark>Emigration is the passage of inflammatory leukocytes between the endothelial cells from blood vessels into the adjacent interstitial tissue</mark>. Before emigration, circulating leukocytes from the central blood flow move toward the endothelial surface.

This process is also known as: leokocyte extravasation or leukocyte adhesion cascade.

* Emigration includes 4 main steps:
    1. Margination
    2. Rolling
    3. Adhesion
    4. Transmigration
<!-- -->


1. **Margination**
    * movement of neutrophils from the center of the lumen towards the wall
<!-- -->
2. **Rolling**
    * endothelial selectins loosely bind to the leukocytes
        * <mark>selectins are proteins present in endothelial cells and are responsible for the initial weak attachement with WBCs.</mark>
    * weak binding/attachement causes leukocytes to "roll" along the endothelial surface
<!-- -->
3. **Adhesion**
    * leukocytes bind much more strongly due to integrins.
    * <mark>integrin proteins mediate stronger adhesion to the endothelial surface.</mark>
    * integrins are on the leukocytes, but they bind to integrin ligands on the endothelium.
        * ICAM-1 ligand
    * attachement is now much stronger than previous stage ("adhered" to the endothelium)

> *Remember:
\
selectins --> weak attachement --> rolling.
\
integrins --> strong attachement --> adhesion.*

So far, the leukocyte has been slowed down and "prepared" to move out of the blood vessel (into adjecent interstitial tissue).

4. **Transmigration**
    * leukocytes move across the endothelium
    * endothelial cells are damaged (hole is made) to allow leukocyte to squeeze out
    * <mark>transmigration is mediated by CD31 protein</mark>
        * CD31 is <mark>also called PECAM-1</mark> (platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1)
        * CD31 utilizes collagenase to degrade basement membrane
    * leukocyte gets out of blood vessel and into the interstitial tissue

> *Side Note: Some textbooks use the term "dipedesis" to refer to the entire emigration process, while some use it to refer to the transmigration phase only.*

### **Chemotaxis**

After leaving the blood vessels, leukocytes need to reach the site of injury.

<mark>Chemotaxis is the active process where phagocytes move toward an increasing concentration of some attractant</mark> (they taxi towards injury, just like how planes taxi towards runways).

Basically: it is the movement of leukocytes/WBCs to the injury site right after leaving the blood vessel.

* Chemotaxis is induced by mediators called chemoattractants
* Both exogenous and endogenous substances can act as chemoattractants
* <mark>Examples of chemoattractants</mark> include:
    * bacterial products, particularly <mark>peptides with N-... termini</mark>
    * cytokines, espcially ones of <mark>chemokine family</mark>
    * components of the complement system, particularly <mark>C5a</mark>
    * products of lipoxygenase pathway of AA metabolism, particularly <mark>LTB4</mark>

>*Remember the major chemoattractants very well*

These chemoattractants attract leukocytes. The nature of leukocyte infiltrate in the tissues depends on the inflammation's age and stimulus type.

Therefore we can determine the nature of the inflammation by determining the nature of the leukocyte infiltrate.


| neutrophils | 6-24 hrs, acute phase |
|:--:|:--:|
macrophages and lymphocytes | 24-48 hrs, maybe more |
|   eosinophils | allergic rxns |



>*Remember from last set of notes, neutrophils are the hallmark of acute inflammatory rxns.*

| ![](https://media.memorang.com/images/5095b120-3b3f-4c9c-865e-b23d0f672837.jpg) |
|:--:|
| *Image (A) on the left has a lot of neutrophils (multilobed nuclei, "mickey mouse" shaped cells), therefore it is an acute inflammation. Image on the right (B) includes macrophages and lymphocytes, therefore it is probably more chronic.* |

>*there may be overlap between the steps, but that does not change their order (see chart)*

>*prof. mentioned that this chart may come on the exam labelled A, B, C and you must know each stage.*


Example cases (that prof. mentioned during the lec):
* 15 y/o girl suffering pain around umbilicus, later radiated to right iliac fossa. Diagnosed with acute appendicitis, underwent appendectomy. Appendix was examined, high amount of neutrophils found, this proved the diagnosis (acute appendicitis).

* A 39 y/o man came in with chest pain, physician gave him ibuprofen, patient died 6 hrs later. Section of the heart was taken, high amount of neutrophils were found, indicating acute myocardial infarction.

### **Leukocyte Activation**

Neutrophils and monocytes are the most important phagocytic cells.

Phagocytosis includes three sequential steps:
* Recognition and attachement
* Engulfement
* Killing and degradation

> *We are now discussing R3 (removal). Emigration and chemotaxis were part of R2 (recruitment).*

1. **Recognition and attachement**
    * carried out by mannose receptors and opsonins (IgG, C3B)
<!-- -->
2. **Engulfment**
    * forms phagosome (phagocytic vacoule)
<!-- -->
3. **Killing and degradation**
    * active process of degradation and intracellular killing is done by neutrophil's bactericides
    * most potent microbicidials are reactive oxygen species (ROS), Nitric Oxide, and NO.H2O2-MPO-halide
    * Nitric Oxide is a soluble gas produced from Arginine by NOS (nitric oxide synthase)
        * 3 types of NOS: eNOS, nNOS, iNOS
        * iNOS is responsible for intracellular killing and is stimulated by interferon-γ (IFN-γ)
        * rxts with superoxide to form radical peroxynitrite

> *prof. mentioned that NO.H2O2-MPO-halide is possibly the most potent neutrophil bactericide*


The quantities of H2O2 produced generally are insufficient to kill most bacteria. However, the granules (lysosomes) of neutrophils  contain enzymes.

* 2 types: large primary granules (azurophilic) and secondary granules
    * primary contain MPO enzyme
    * secondary contain lysozyme, etc.
<!-- -->
* Granules are neutralized (kept in check) by anti-proteases (e.g: α-1 antitrypsin)
    * α-1 antitrypsin inhibits elastases
    * α-1 antitrypsin deficiency can lead chronic disease and injury

|:--:|:--:|

Neutrophils also secrete "neutrophil extracellular traps" (NETs).

* When the neutrophil dies, chromatin material will spill outside
* NETs are a meshwork of thick viscous nuclear chromatin after the neutrophil dies
* prevent the spread of the microbes (trap)
<!-- -->
* NETs play a major role in the pathogenesis of spesis/septicemia
* Maybe involved in SLE (Systemic Lupus Erythematosus)
    * multisystem autoimmune disease
    * affects young females, causes rash on cheeks

> *prof. metioned that the most dangerous septicemia is gram negative septic shock*

Activated leukocytes/WBCs also serve to:

* serve to amplify or limit immune rxn (via cytokines)
* growth factor secretion for repair
* T-helper-17 is a major player in acute inflammation
    * produces IL-17
    * IL-17 deficiency can cause disease

### **Leukocyte Mediated Tissue Injury**

Because leukocytes are capable of secreting potentially harmful substances such as enzymes and ROS, they are important causes of injury to normal cells and tissues under several circumstances. These circumstances include:

* Prolonged inflammation
    * e.g: tubercolosis (TB) or hepatitis
<!-- -->
* Inappropriate inflammatory responses
    * autoimmune diseases
<!-- -->
* Exaggerated responses
    * e.g: asthma and allergic rxns
