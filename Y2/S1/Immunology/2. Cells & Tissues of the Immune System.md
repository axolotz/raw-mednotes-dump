## **Overview**
---

Immune cells are present as circulating cells in the blood and lymph, either as collections in lymphoid organs, or as scattered cells across all tissues.

* <mark>Most immune cells start as hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow.</mark>
* Hematopoietic cells give rise to either myeloid or lymphoid cells.
* Myeloid/Lymphoid cells can then differentiate into other cells.

| *know that lymphoid cells give rise to T-cells, and B-cells, and NK cells (natural killer cells). Most other cells will probably be from myeloid origin.* |

Summed up: <mark>Hematopoietic --> Myeloid OR Lymphoid --> other cells</mark>


<!-- -->
We will discuss 4 main types of cells:
* Phagocytes
* Mast cells, basophils, and eosinphils.
* Antigen-presenting cells.
* Lymphocytes


## **Phagocytes**
---

### **Neutrophils**

* classed as phagocytes
* most abundant leukocyte (WBC) in circulation
* <mark>single nucleus consisting of 3-5 connected lobes</mark>
* AKA "polymorphonuclear leukocyte"
    * meaning "multishaped nuclei"

<!-- -->
* <mark>Neutrophils mediate the earliest phases of inflammatory rxns</mark> (i.e: innate immunity)
    * short lifespan (circulate for about 6 hrs)
    * migrate within hrs, function for few hrs then die off
* <mark>Neutrophil production is stimulated by G-CSF</mark>
<!-- -->
* Possess granulated cytoplasm.
    * two granule types: specific and azurophilic.
        * specific: contains lysozomes, collagenase, elastase, etc.
            * collagenase/elastase help the cell move by breaking down ECM tissue
        * azurophilic: contains other enzymes
<!-- -->
* May undergo programmed explosions to create "neutrophil extracellular traps" (NETs) to trap pathogens
    * NETs are composed of DNA
    * NETs may also kill pathogens via attached microbicidial substrates.

<mark>**Neutropenia:** abnormally low neutrophil concentration in blood.</mark>
* indicates bone marrow damage
    * may be congenital or acquired
    * may occur as a result of chemotherapy
* person may suffer from reccurect infections
* <mark>one possible treatment is the use of G-CSF</mark> to stimulate neutrophil production.

### **Macrophages**

Macrophages are mononuclear phagocytes.

* Mononuclear phagocytes originate from the same precursor cells (in the bone marrow)
* These precursors mature into monocytes, which enter and circulate in the blood
    * these monocytes can either differentiate into macrophages or dendritic cells
* When a monocyte exits blood and enters tissue, it can mature into a macrophage
* Macrophages can either be activated (fight infection, injury, etc.) or they can further differentiate.
    * (e.g: become osteoclast in bone, kupffer in liver, etc.)

* Macrophages function to:
    * ingest dead host cells to "clean up" after infection or tissue injury
